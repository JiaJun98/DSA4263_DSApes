Adjectives like \"gluten free\" may also indicate some context to the topic, indicating healthy products. Hence, we focus on looking at nouns and adjective. However, there are also nouns and adjective that do not really value add to the topics such as \"amazon\", \"taste\", \"great\". We resolve this issue by adding words into stop words list."

I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.\n",

      "Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.  I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout.\n",

I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this!

      "Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!! Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more. And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM! smiles, grace in VT\n",

Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.  I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.  5 stars.\n",

      "I discovered these at my local Trader Joe's but then they stopped carrying them.  I hunted and located them under their original 'colors'.  They make a very tasty vegetable broth - carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths.\n",

      "Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.  The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.  The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.  I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.  The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.  I like these a lot. They make a great snack.\n",

      "For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.  The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.\n",

      "I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.

      "This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The \"mouth feel\" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an \"emergency treat\" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.\n",

      "I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.\n",

      "These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.\n",

Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.  I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!  While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.\n",

      "Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.  On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.\n",

      "Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored \"cake\".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.\n",

I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively.

He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!\n",

      "I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.\n",

      "My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed \"stuff\". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!\n",

      "This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.\n",

I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his \"treat.\" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these.\n",
