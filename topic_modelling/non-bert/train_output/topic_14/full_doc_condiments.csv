You will not be disappointed.  I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste.

When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish.

Everyone love it.

3080,"I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un-popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.  I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.  We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.  I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.  *Update* 8/25/11  Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.

4014,"I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.  I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).  My secret pate recipe:  5 ounces rendered duck fat 1 lb chicken livers 1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons) 1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press 1 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 1 tbs cognac or dry sherry One loaf of 2""x2"" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter) Olive oil Garlic salt Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator. Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.","['rendered', 'duck', 'fat', 'company', 'expensive', 'better', 'chicken', 'liver', 'pate', 'best', 'palletes', 'pate', 'duck', 'fat', '1-2', 'pound', 'raw', 'liver', 'fat', 'tollerance', 'secret', 'pate', 'recipe', 'ounce', 'duck', 'fat', 'lb', 'chicken', 'liver', 'large', 'shallot', 'tablespoon', 'tsp', 'provence', 'rosemary', 'marjoram', 'thyme', 'work', 'garlic', 'press', 'tsp', 'sea', 'salt', 'ground', 'black', 'pepper', 'tb', 'cognac', 'dry', 'sherry', 'loaf', 'rye', 'pumpernickel', 'bread', 'look', 'deli', 'counter', 'olive', 'oil', 'garlic', 'salt', 'pate', 'ingredient', 'liver', 'allow', 'mixture', 'food', 'processor', 'add', 'mixture', 'food', 'processer', 'adjust', 'seasoning', 'cognac', 'cool', 'refrigerator', 'bread', 'heat', 'bread', 'slice', 'olive', 'oil', 'place', 'single', 'layer', 'sheet', 'pan', 'garlic', 'salt', 'cook', 'minute', 'hard', 'crouton-like', 'doneness']",6
