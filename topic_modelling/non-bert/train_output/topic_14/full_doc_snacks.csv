92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.","['lot', 'cereal', 'lot', 'high-fiber', 'kind', 'oatmeal', 'mini', 'shredded', 'wheat', 'raisin', 'bran', 'instance', 'healthier', 'option', 'tried', 'kashi', 'cereal', 'plain', 'cardboard', 'grape', 'nut', 'horrendous', 'yeast', 'cat', 'food', 'closer', 'litter', 'texture', 'antioxidant', 'berry', 'yogurt', 'crunch', 'better', 'high-fiber', 'cereal', 'decent', 'health', 'bar', 'broken', 'cereal', 'cluster', 'yogurt', 'plain', 'cereal', 'decent', 'yes', 'sugar', 'fiber', 'calorie', 'part', 'bran', 'wheat', 'higher', 'sugar', 'calorie', 'lower', 'dietary', 'antioxidant', 'bonus', 'line', 'grocery', 'list', 'sale', 'price', 'right']",4

122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.

152,"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}  I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.  This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review.","['lot', 'variability', 'macadamians', 'producer', 'bag', 'perfect', 'degree', 'bitterness', 'hard', 'consistency', 'early', 'perfect', 'consistency', 'flavor', 'vast', 'majority', 'half', 'smaller', 'piece', 'bag', 'period', 'excellent', 'macadamia', 'nut', 'regular', 'diet', 'bad', 'cholesterol', 'high', 'content', 'fat', 'low', 'carbs', 'simple', 'carbs', 'edge', 'appetite', 'nut', 'low', 'oxalate', 'regular', 'use', 'risk', 'kidney', 'stone', 'pistachio', 'walnut', 'low', 'oxalate', 'catch', 'high', 'healthy', 'fat', 'content', 'high', 'calorie', 'count', 'unit', 'volume', 'bullet', 'large', 'container', 'happy', '5-star', 'review']",4

I also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup.  It gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat.  My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.

927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.

988,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.  The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.  However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.","['favorite', 'healthy', 'cereal', 'mix', 'texture', 'flavor', 'sweet', 'indulgent', 'nut', 'cereal', 'huge', 'fan', 'banana', 'distinguishable', 'sweet', 'fruity', 'flavor', 'cereal', 'slight', 'nuttiness', 'flax', 'green', 'tea', 'subtle', 'undetectable', 'flavor', 'cereal', 'downside', 'cereal', 'healthy', 'cereal', 'market', 'calorie', 'cup', 'gram', 'fiber', 'gram', 'protein', 'kashi', 'golean', 'cereal', '14.1-ounce', 'box', 'pack', 'calorie', 'gram', 'fiber', 'g', 'protein', 'cup', 'result', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'filling', 'hungrier', 'faster', 'golean', 'breakfast', 'flavor', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'sweeter', 'complex', 'nutritionals', 'bit', 'tastier', 'healthier', 'mainstream', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'difference', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'kashi', 'golean', 'flavor', 'best', 'word', 'cereal', 'overall', 'cereal', 'kashi', 'golean', 'bland']",4

1064,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them.

(2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.  (3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.  (4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.

If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving.

They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack.

2483,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).

The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.  This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.

2798,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):  Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)  )","['review', 'people', 'alot', 'product', 'review', 'time', 'total', 'complete', 'popchips', 'star', '1-2', 'packaging', 'extra', 'point', 'better', 'version', 'baked', 'lay', 'man', 'wrong', 'baked', 'lay', 'flavor', 'go-to', 'original', 'baked', 'lay', 'sour', 'cream', 'lay', 'favorite', 'regular', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'flavor', 'popchips', 'burnt', 'airpocket', 'chip', 'baked', 'lay', 'benefit', 'use', 'portion', 'control', 'zip', 'lock', 'bunch', 'baked', 'lay', 'way', 'summary', 'popchips', 'burnt', 'air', 'chip', 'sort', 'weird', 'alot', 'suggest', 'bag', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'week', 'm', 'local', 'krogers', 'nutrition', 'information', 'bag', 'calorie', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'mg', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'g', 'sugar', 'protein', 'g', 'vitamin', 'c', 'calcium', 'iron', 'big', 'bag', 'bbq', 'popchips', 'big', 'bag', 'bbq', 'lay', 'nutrition', 'information', 'side-by-side', 'pop', 'chip', 'size', 'chip', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'baked', 'lay', 'chip', 'calorie', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'potassium', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'vitamin', 'c', 'calcium', 'lay', 'win', 'potassium', 'sodium', 'leaving', 'potassium', 'fiber', 'vitamin', 'better', 'careful', 'sodium', 'intake', 'fact', 'lay', 'potassium', 'huge', 'benefit', 'end', 'decision', 'bag', 'store', 'favorite', 'flavor', 'baked', 'lay', 'popchips', 'lay', 'hand', 'start', 'well-priced', 'variety', 'single-serve', 'bag', 'baked', 'lay', 'seller', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'bag', 'smart', 'mix', 'variety', 'pack', '30-count', '7-baked', 'lay', 'classic', '6-baked', 'cheetos', '6-baked', 'ruffle', '6-baked', 'doritos', 'cheese', '5-rold', 'gold', 'tiny', 'twist', 'pack']",4

I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.  This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.

You will see how much money you save do NOT eating at a restaurant, bringing you own snaks and lunch from home.","['flavor', 'lunch', 'daily', 'cal', 'meal', 'lot', 'money', 'time', 'office', 'restaurant', 'guilty', 'free', 'bcuz', 'vegan', 'solution', 'lunch', 'time', 'weekday', 'daily', 'look', 'place', 'vegetarian', 'safe', 'healthy', 'money', 'restaurant', 'snaks', 'lunch', 'home']",4

4243,"I don't like cinnamon and I don't like apples, so I was surprised when a friend offered me  Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  and I liked it. I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.  I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh.","['cinnamon', 'apple', 'friend', 'fruit', 'organic', 'bake-dried', 'cinnamon', 'apple', 'chip', 'ounce', 'bag', 'pack', 'cinnamon', 'pound', 'bad', 'chip', 'reviewer', 'musty', 'roommate', 'pound', 'chip', 'sour', 'reason', 'star', 'packaging', 'nutrition', 'information', 'easy', 'livestrong', 'chip', 'different', 'size', 'easy', 'cup', 'calorie', 'food', 'scale', 'case', 'use', 'gram', 'chip', 'calorie', 'g', 'carbs', 'g', 'fiber', 'dad', 'different', 'variety', 'fruit', 'tree', 'apple', 'apple', 'care', 'non-organic', 'unhealthy', 'reason', 'shiny', 'bag', 'bag', 'ziplocs', 'able', 'snack', 'sort', 'soft', 'chip', 'original', 'bag', 'ziplock', 'crispy', 'fresh']",4
4261,"I enjoy these so much more than traditional (fried) banana chips.  They do really stick to your teeth a lot, but it's as sweet as candy (even without added sugar) so I wouldn't consider that a huge detriment.

I love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home. These work well and taste great.
