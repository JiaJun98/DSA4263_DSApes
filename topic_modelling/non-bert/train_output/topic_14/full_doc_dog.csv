15,I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund. I was very please with the seller's response.,"['healthy', 'treat', 'dog', 'box', 'box', 'way', 'treat', 'hole', 'plastic', 'outside', 'evidence', 'date', 'couple', 'month', 'people', 'time', 'refund', 'seller', 'response']",5

140,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.  Delivery was unexpectedly fast.  The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack.

Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.

221,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs!

Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.

I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.

I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink.

FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]","['package', 'price', 'refund', 'trash', 'fda', 'web', 'site', 'fda', 'dog', 'owner', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'product', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'fda', 'consumer', 'jerky', 'product', 'dog', 'chicken', 'tender', 'treat', 'illness', 'dog', 'month', 'fda', 'increase', 'number', 'complaint', 'dog', 'illness', 'consumption', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'product', 'china', 'complaint', 'dog', 'owner', 'veterinarian', 'cautionary', 'warning', 'jerky', 'product', 'consumer', 'september', 'preliminary', 'animal', 'health', 'notification', 'december', 'number', 'complaint', 'drop', 'fda', 'number', 'complaint', 'rise', 'level', 'concern', 'release', 'earlier', 'warning', 'jerky', 'product', 'balanced', 'diet', 'small', 'quantity', 'consumer', 'dog', 'jerky', 'product', 'dog', 'following', 'sign', 'hour', 'day', 'product', 'decreased', 'activity', 'diarrhea', 'blood', 'increased', 'water', 'consumption', 'urination', 'dog', 'sign', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'owner', 'veterinarian', 'sign', 'severe', 'persist', 'hour', 'blood', 'test', 'kidney', 'failure', 'urea', 'nitrogen', 'creatinine', 'urine', 'test', 'fanconi', 'syndrome', 'glucose', 'dog', 'report', 'fda', 'dog', 'fda', 'addition', 'animal', 'health', 'diagnostic', 'laboratory', 'product', 'illness', 'dog', 'veterinary', 'laboratory', 'response', 'network', 'vlrn', 'available', 'animal', 'health', 'diagnostic', 'laboratory', 'date', 'scientist', 'able', 'definitive', 'cause', 'reported', 'illness', 'extensive', 'chemical', 'microbial', 'testing', 'contaminant', 'fda', 'problem', 'origin', 'illness', 'result', 'cause', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'veterinarian', 'consumer', 'case', 'animal', 'illness', 'pet', 'food', 'fda', 'consumer', 'complaint', 'coordinator', 'state']",5

3357,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed.

3672,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.

4175,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.

4228,5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili. The only thing that concerns me is the 11 grams of sugar. That can't be good for you.,"['star', 'beef', 'taste', 'chili', 'thing', 'concern', 'gram', 'sugar']",5
4241,"My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes.","['dog', 'busy', 'bone', 'minute', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'bit', 'addition', 'treat', 'chew', 'thing', 'messy', 'floor', 'paw', 'sticky', 'goop', 'easy', 'expensive', 'minute']",5
4270,"I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.  dp","['disappointed', 'happy', 'hip', 'china', 'pet', 'food', 'store', 'product', 'usa', 'dog', 'new', 'bichon', 'cabinet', 'cry', 'treat', 'lamb', 'jerkey', 'dehydrator', 'work', 'regulation', 'china', 'floor', 'packaging', 'ingredents', 'scary', 'usa', 'dp']",5
4272,"I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:  Me:  opening the bag ""you want a treat?"" Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"".  She looks back up at me.  ""sniff"".  She walks away and lays down in her bed. Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside ""wrapping"".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.  I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried.","['picky', 'dog', 'tummy', 'trouble', 'prescription', 'diet', 'newman', 'treat', 'hard', 'half', 'teeth', 'crunching', 'sound', 'newman', 'treat', 'center', 'little', 'easier', 'trial', 'bag', 'treat', 'dog', 'tail', 'ear', 'treat', 'bag', 'hand', 'dog', 'floor', 'sniff', 'sniff', 'bed', 'treat', 'sniff', 'dog', 'outside', 'wrapping', 'tough', 'middle', 'little', 'hard', 'softer', 'middle', 'middle', 'treat', 'place', 'bite', 'cheese', 'ritual', 'sniffed', 'treat', 'beggin', 'strip', 'blue', 'bison', 'biscuit', 'milk', 'bone', 'mouth', 'minute', 'safe', 'place', 'treat', 'honor']",5

4292,Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago.  The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming.

4333,My vet recommended these treats to help with my cats tartar build up. The treats come in a wrapper which I think is edible but I take it off. One cat LOVES these treats and the other won't touch them. But...the AMZN price is so so much cheaper (about 1/3 the cost) than the vets price. I wouldn't buy them anywhere but AMZN.,"['vet', 'treat', 'cat', 'treat', 'wrapper', 'edible', 'cat', 'treat', 'amzn', 'price', 'cheaper', 'cost', 'vet', 'price']",5
