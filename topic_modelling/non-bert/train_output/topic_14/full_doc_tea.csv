2,I just brewed my first cup and the aroma and flavor both speak of autumn and harvest.  I LOVE the flavor.  I would highly recommend this herbal tea.,"['cup', 'aroma', 'flavor', 'speak', 'autumn', 'harvest', 'flavor', 'herbal', 'tea']",11
18,I drink a lot of teas and tisanes so I like to try different kinds from time to time. I've been drinking this for a few weeks and it's fantastic. Even before I brewed this I knew it was going to be good just from the aroma. (Actually it would make a great potpourri on its own.) It brews up a nice deep color with a good flavor. I highly recommend this.,"['lot', 'tea', 'tisane', 'different', 'kind', 'time', 'time', 'week', 'fantastic', 'aroma', 'potpourri', 'deep', 'color', 'flavor']",11
55,"I have been using this for a year now, very good in tea, I use it on anything. My son puts it on his cereal, he is a very picky eater and he has no clue it isn't real sugar.

75,I love the strength and taste of PG Tips.

91,"I am not a health nut and I had to keep an open mind with this product... but once I tried it it actually tasted really good. Just a tip, don't eat it by itself (not good).

111,"I drink a LOT of tea. I probably drink around 14 cups a day, and I drink the good stuff. All whole leaf, quality, loose-tea. So I know a good cup of tea when I see one.  These are the ONLY bottles of tea that are of FANTASTIC quality.  Ito-En makes amazing stuff, and this is my absolute favorite tea from them.

143,"I've been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites.

195,We have been paying big bucks for little cans of Rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon.

199,"i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious.  i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious.  both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste, less subtle than other graham crackers.  i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie.  with no hesitation she said yes.  this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips.  lana is with me in highly recommending BACK TO NATURE GOLDEN HONEY OAT GRAHAMS.","['graham', 'cracker', 'delicious', 'graham', 'cracker', 'lana', 'graham', 'cracker', 'delicious', 'lana', 'strong', 'oat', 'lingering', 'graham', 'cracker', 'subtle', 'graham', 'cracker', 'lana', 'cracker', 'crust', 'banana', 'cream', 'key', 'lime', 'pie', 'hesitation', 'wonderful', 'alternative', 'snack', 'cooky', 'chip', 'lana', 'nature', 'golden', 'honey', 'oat', 'graham']",11
201,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor.

203,"This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!

207,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.  So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.  This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.  Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]  Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those ""You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone"" sorts of things, I guess.

209,I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.

788,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

790,"I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.

I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.  After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.  What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.  I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea).

There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.  The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.

My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.

4211,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.  By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings.
