29,I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.,"['box', 'gift', 'box', 'piece', 'seder', 'gift', 'return', 'window', 'april', 'ridiculous', 'matzo', 'seder', 'april', 'night']",10
32,"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product.","['review', 'safe', 'package', 'regret', 'pack', 'bean', 'moment', 'bag', 'stale', 'sour', 'smell', 'optimistic', 'bean', 'fresh', 'plump', 'maybe', 'seed', 'wrong', 'test', 'batch', 'salt', 'vanilla', 'salt', 'sour', 'rancid', 'smell', 'vanilla', 'salt', 'day', 'smell', 'jar', 'vanilla', 'salt', 'cheap', 'gift', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'disappointed', 'seed', 'smell', 'transforms', 'heat', 'mixed', 'ingredient', 'sure', 'vanilla', 'extract', 'vanilla', 'sugar', 'vanilla', 'salt']",10
96,"I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesn't have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World.","['wonderful', 'homemade', 'vanilla', 'recipe', 'line', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'williams', 'sonoma', 'spicy', 'world', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'expensive', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'williams', 'sonoma', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'williams', 'sonoma', 'pint', 'vodka', 'dark', 'aromatic', 'vanilla', 'month', 'spicy', 'world', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'pint', 'vodka', 'month', 'liquid', 'weak', 'tea', 'aroma', 'alcohol', 'bean', 'result', 'vanilla', 'vanilla', 'aroma', 'vanilla', 'disappointed', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'spicy', 'world', 'worthless', 'complete', 'waste', 'money', 'spicy', 'world']",10

307,"You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.  I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.  I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all.

When reading the reviews of the waffle maker, so many mentioned this waffle mix that I figured I would give it a try instead of making my own. I'm so glad I did! I used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly. From start to finish this morning, I was enjoying fresh waffles in 5 minutes.

I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication.

Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.  I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.

Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.
