105,"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger ""house"" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.  I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat.

221,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs!

527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.","['icicle', 'mic', 'xlr', 'jack', 'computer', 'usb', 'jack', 'phantom', 'power', 'mics', 'signal', 'software', 'usefulness', 'mic', 'acceptable', 'level', 'akg', 'blue', 'encore', 'akg', 'sound', 'conventional', 'recording', 'chain', 'audible', 'record', 'level', 'encore', 'staple', 'location', 'voice', 'encore', 'digital', 'audio', 'recorder', 'xlr', 'cable', 'mic', 'preamp', 'phantom', 'power', 'eq', 'clean', 'clear', 'sound', 'level', 'peak', 'input', 'level', 'disappointing', 'mic', 'preamp', 'icicle', 'preamp', 'usb', 'input', 'computer', 'decent', 'record', 'level', 'extra', 'equipment', 'light', 'weight', 'gadget', 'better', 'decent', 'channel', 'strip', 'mic', 'preamp', 'xlr', 'jack', 'channel', 'strip', 'computer', 'input', 'icicle', 'blue', 'product', 'better', 'one', 'channel', 'combine', 'piece', 'equipment', 'box', 'mic', 'preamp', 'compressor', 'higher', 'end', 'unit', 'eq', 'capability', 'option']",2

With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom.

1293,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess.","['wow', 'macaroni', 'cheese', 'long', 'time', 'annie', 'additional', 'milk', 'butter', 'sauce', 'easy-to-squeeze', 'paste', 'foil', 'package', 'receptacle', 'creativity', 'tip', 'boil', 'plenty', 'water', 'six-cup', 'requirement', 'minimum', 'drain', 'pasta', 'hot', 'pot', 'heat', 'right', 'cheesy', 'sauce', 'macaroni', 'pasta', 'cold', 'water', 'hard', 'sauce', 'deluxe', 'version', 'animal', 'rennet', 'free', 'annie', 'faq', 'specific', 'one', 'vegetable', 'rennet', 'information', 'vegetarian', 'one', 'animal', 'rennet-free', 'sundried', 'tomato', 'fresh', 'tomato', 'olive', 'oil', 'garlic', 'pizza', 'pepper', 'pepper', 'touch', 'balsamic', 'vinegar', 'paste', 'mac', 'cheese', 'new', 'gourmet', 'mac', 'cheesiness', 'chipotle', 'sauce', 'addition', 'adventurous', 'smoky', 'creaminess']",2
