45,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,"['lowrey', 'pork', 'rind', 'unacceptable', 'bag', 'bag', 'bag', 'rind', 'money', 'store', 'bag', 'bag', 'half', 'bag', 'penny', 'consumer', 'money', 'reason']",0

77,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

I would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price, but I can imagine people who would.  I have to take issue with the packaging, though.

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.  As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk.

The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.

There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.  One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.  My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.","['chip', 'salt', 'finger', 'key', 'way', 'flavor', 'stone-ground', 'corn', 'ingredient', 'nutty', 'aftertaste', 'texture', 'right', 'crunch', 'chip', 'salty', 'nutrition-wise', 'chip', 'rank', 'healthy', 'version', 'calorie', 'ounce', 'lot', 'normal', 'similar', 'product', 'fat', 'sodium', 'lot', 'lower', 'fiber', 'average', 'daily', 'requirement', 'trans', 'preservative', 'foodshouldtastegood', 'company', 'effort', 'healthy', 'possible', 'ingredient', 'requirement', 'reviewer', 'chip', 'hard', 'tasted', 'stale', 'experience', 'chip', 'fresh', 'crunchy', 'mean', 'harder', 'crunchier', 'regular', 'tortilla', 'chip', 'expiration', 'date', 'bag', 'november', 'preservative', 'odd', 'bag', 'reviewer', 'expiration', 'date', 'hesitation', 'price', 'chip', 'stock', 'pricing', 'chip', 'better', 'health', 'brand']",0
1213,"My wife introduced me to these - we bought them at the Japanese store in Epcot.  After we'd eaten the two we bought, I wanted to find them on the web, so I was pleased to see you could get them at Amazon.  This is a tasty noodle dish.  It's not what I first thought - a soup.  It is really noodles, with a spicy mustard, mayo, soy sauce mix.  It's easy to prepare as well - the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water.  The container is pretty neat too - a built in strainer that lets you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls.

I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific. I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$.

I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)).

2184,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.  The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...  Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.  The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.  And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.  The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.  But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"".

I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!

Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.  The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.  And the chocolate square is nummy. :D  The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.

I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor.

It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.

Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors.

3661,"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one.

4040,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again.

4135,"A word of caution to anyone considering buying these: Read the ingredients first! I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.","['word', 'caution', 'ingredient', 'mistake', 'longer', 'oberto', 'brand', 'one', 'local', 'costco', 'bag', 'volume', 'discount', 'time', 'right', 'bag', 'whiff', 'ingredient', 'pork', 'heart', 'ingredient', 'doubt', 'expensive', 'doggy', 'treat']",0

I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!

4167,This tea is very tasty. It doesn't have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other Thai tea mixes have. I'm very pleased with it. I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream. The lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink.,"['tea', 'unappealing', 'fresh', 'paint', 'smell', 'thai', 'tea', 'mix', 'pleased', 'reviewer', 'price', 'high', 'area', 'asian', 'store', 'bag', 'shipping', 'shipping', 'bag', 'shipping', 'cost', 'reviewer', 'tea', 'water', 'milk', 'tea', 'hot', 'cold', 'cream', 'lovely', 'orange', 'color', 'cream', 'milk', 'color', 'charm', 'drink']",0

4243,"I don't like cinnamon and I don't like apples, so I was surprised when a friend offered me  Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  and I liked it. I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.  I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh.","['cinnamon', 'apple', 'friend', 'fruit', 'organic', 'bake-dried', 'cinnamon', 'apple', 'chip', 'ounce', 'bag', 'pack', 'cinnamon', 'pound', 'bad', 'chip', 'reviewer', 'musty', 'roommate', 'pound', 'chip', 'sour', 'reason', 'star', 'packaging', 'nutrition', 'information', 'easy', 'livestrong', 'chip', 'different', 'size', 'easy', 'cup', 'calorie', 'food', 'scale', 'case', 'use', 'gram', 'chip', 'calorie', 'g', 'carbs', 'g', 'fiber', 'dad', 'different', 'variety', 'fruit', 'tree', 'apple', 'apple', 'care', 'non-organic', 'unhealthy', 'reason', 'shiny', 'bag', 'bag', 'ziplocs', 'able', 'snack', 'sort', 'soft', 'chip', 'original', 'bag', 'ziplock', 'crispy', 'fresh']",0
