1293,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous.

Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.  I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.  So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.  So I'm stuck with 11 packs.  See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.

2148,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""

2284,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).

2483,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).
