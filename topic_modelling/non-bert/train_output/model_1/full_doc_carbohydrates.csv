10,These have GOT to be the BEST tasting gluten free cookies I have EVER tasted. I was just blown away by the taste and texture. My husband couldn't believe it was Gluten Free.

186,"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.  One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad.

They restored hope that I can have good food without the ""aftermath"" that typically comes with eating.  My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them.

If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.

They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter.

That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!

Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far.

1293,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous.

1895,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)!

2148,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).

2483,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).  It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.

Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.

3910,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.","['ok', 'bisquick', 'gf', 'thing', 'drop', 'box', 'kind', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'result', 'gf', 'bisquick', 'original', 'tart', 'original', 'similar', 'buttermilk', 'buttermilk', 'milk', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'odd', 'problem', 'new', 'mix', 'right', 'box', 'cup', 'mix', 'box', 'serving', 'cup', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'cup', 'mix', 'teaspoonful', 'measuring', 'cup', 'cup', 'mix', 'bag', 'mix', 'wheat', 'flour', 'kind', 'flour', 'measure', 'bag', 'cup', 'recipe', 'misprint', 'box', 'biscuit', 'gravy', 'butter', 'jam', 'yummy', 'mcdonald', 'breakfast', 'sandwich', 'instruction', 'lot', 'biscuit', 'single', 'recipe', 'half', 'plenty', 'box', 'mix', 'cost', 'box', 'biscuit', 'budget', 'biscuit', 'golden', 'recipe', 'egg', 'crumbly', 'glutenous', 'one', 'egg', 'eye-appealing', 'color', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'cut-in', 'shortening', 'cutter', 'long', 'fork', 'difficult', 'celiac', 'biscuit', 'cutter', 'box', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'milk', 'tart', 'reminiscent', 'original', 'bisquick', 'mix', 'rice', 'flour', 'sugar', 'potato', 'starch', 'salt', 'xanthum', 'mix', 'goody', 'rice', 'flour', 'grainy', 'bisquick', 'fantastic', 'job', 'rice', 'flour', 'repeat', 'new', 'starch', 'corn', 'potato', 'tapioca', 'normal', 'lightness', 'baked', 'item', 'possible', 'rice', 'leavening', 'soda', 'powder', 'necessary', 'sugar', 'salt', 'flavor', 'consistency', 'yes', 'necessary', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'celiac-safe', 'baked', 'good', 'bit', 'elasticity', 'replacement', 'gluten', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'baked', 'goodie', 'people', 'celiac', 'disease', 'mix', 'money', 'sure', 'difficult', 'time', 'ground', 'rice', 'flour', 'predominant', 'main', 'ingredient', 'mix', 'recipe', 'box', 'pancake', 'waffle', 'shortcake', 'crust', 'ultimate', 'chicken', 'finger', 'chicken', 'recipe', 'website', 'mix', 'box', 'price']",5

The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.  I simply loved it.

Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?

I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste.

Gluten is a toxin for many, especially those with Celiac Disease, Autism, Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues.
