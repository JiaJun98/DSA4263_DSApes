Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  "Hey Brian," I said. "You got anything to drink?"  "Yeah!" he replied. "I've got some lavender soda in the fridge."  "Lavender soda?" I asked, skeptical. "Where does a person even get lavender soda?"  "It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it." Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, "What have I gotten myself into this time?" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. "Interesting," I thought. "Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first." However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to "wash my mouth out with soap" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.

I remember well the "Beer Nuts" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of "Beer Nuts" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask "Beer Nuts" ... 'What happened?'

I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.

I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.  It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.  While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.  I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it.

My wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. However, this gravy is fantastic, idiot proof (even I can make it) and reminds me of my grandma's cooking. My wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard.

Topic 1
sugar, chocolate, drink, sweet, calorie, juice, water, cooky, bar, little

If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing.

I am disappointed in this product. First, there's a distinct aftertaste. Secondly, it is not as sweet as they promise, and doesn't work at all in cold drinks.  If you need a sugar substitute I suggest Somersweet, not perfect either but better than this.   Sorry I was taken in by the promises.

Calorie count is good. The orange smoothie is the best.  These bars used to be sold by costco. They are much moister than other bars.

These taste great. Very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies. 10 lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it's a great value if you're a "natural" candy lover. This comes shipped in a plastic bag so I recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage (2 gallon size or thereabouts).

These diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant, non-sticky crunch. With 6 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber to 6 grams of sugar and only 120 calories, they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so-called diet products.  I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.  Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening. These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too.

Topic 2
salt, sauce, product, oil, little, fat, noodle, bean, cheese, pasta

Received the product fast!  The taste was as expected for this type of cheese. Good texture, flavor, slightly dry excellent for grating over salads and seafood and pasta.

I found this Fajita sauce and the related Chimichurri sauce at a local Global Foods mart, but after using the bottles up, my wife recycled them and I had forgotten the brand name.  So I spent the next 6 months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping - apparently the local mart stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I bought lots of Chimichurri sauce brands - most of which were not nearly as delicious as I recalled this brand to be - until on a whim I looked up "chimichurri" here on Amazon.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the World Harbors label, I recognized the brand again! :-)  Anyway, whenever I make burritos or tacos, I add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family & guests now think I should go into the restaurant business! :-P

I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!  Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended.

OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.

This grain is an excellent substitute for rice.  it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of Quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy, sauce, mixed vegetables or anything you like.

Topic 3
food, dog, product, cat, free, treat, baby, gluten, diet, healthy

The basis of my diet is using the Zesty Italian with little or no oil and I still get that great taste.

This product is very tasty but if you are also lactose intolerant, better forgo the pleasure.  Milk is not listed on the allergy advisory (May contain traces of...) but the ingredients section lists whole milk powder as a component of the chocolate coating.  Otherwise, it's a great product.

Tastes terrible. I should have known given that it was on sale but I am throwing the rest of the case out, I have tried it twice now and once poured it out thinking I had a bad one and the 2nd time bearly held it down.

I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!

My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!

Topic 4
product, store, box, order, local, grocery, item, grocery store, bag, better

I was able to get a bottle for $1.00 through a relay for life food sale.  This is the best juice ever!

I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger "house" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.  I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat. I have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 525cs.

They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable.

These biscuits are really good! I bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch. I think they are a lot better than Nutri grain bars and Quaker Oats granola bars. I've also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better. It's also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet: [...]/ or just Google Belvita coupons!

These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

Topic 5
coffee, tea, cup, strong, green, hot, product, brand, bitter, bean

This coffe was over priced and not a true French roast. I would not describe it as dark or bold in flavor.  Would have been helpful if a price per pod was added.

I wish Gevalia came with an option for whole beans, but as pre-ground coffee goes, this makes a great Sunday morning treat. It may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee, but if you like candy-coffee, you will probably like this.

I was pleased when Amazon decided to sell Community Coffee since I long ago decided it was the best of the rich, strong flavored Louisiana coffees.  The private reserve coffees Community Coffee sells are quite good, just as I remembered them being when I lived in Baton Rouge many, many years ago.  Community Coffees offer a consistently rich, flavorful roast.  The price is reasonable especially with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  I make my own blends of Sumatran, French Roast, Columbian and Espresso and am very happy with the results.

The taste of these teas are great. but i added honey to make it a little more sweet.

I've been drinking peppermint tea for about 25 year. In fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch. To me, this tea tastes great, and has a good minty kick to it. I'd certainly purchase this again. I use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup I use. At this moment I am drinking a 20oz cup and the strength is good. I declare this a phenomenal value!

I don't normally write reviews, I can't be bothered. The reason for this review is this pasta is fantastic. I have MS and it was recomended to me to do a gluten free diet. I'm Italian and pasta is important to Italians. I now enjoy pasta as before, this pasta tastes like regular pasta. I have recomended it to my friends that are on gluten free diets and they love it also. Try it you will never regret it.

Kraft homestyle mayonnaise is rich and creamy. A very good quality mayonnaise. I will certainly buy more of same. Previously I've bought mayonnaise that sits in the fridge for ages. Maybe for generations! This mayonnaise will go fast because it taste so good. I've used on tuna, hard boiled eggs and salad. I highly recommend.

These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.

This is the best salad dressing I've ever had. It really does taste like bruschetta, and since it's oil-based instead of cream, it's way healthier. Five stars!

I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.  When I eat them, I don't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don't make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I'd buy them every single day!

This is the best K-cup tea I've found so far. It tastes very good and doesn't use the word "exotic" to add random spices that are not necessary. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful.

This is just and FYI for you guys, you ca buy this exact same box, of these exact same noodles at a korean market for around 16$'s. You can get them for .80-.99$'s (most placed will still cut you a bulk deal for around 18$ a box) from any grocery store with an Asian section (I'm sure they're 5$'s a piece in California, NY or "wherever" so chill out ninnies). Don't get ripped off for these if you've got any of the aforementioned within easy access.

This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.

The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling).

i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then "drink up"..blech.

The price great. The only thing that could be better is an assortment.

When I'm in a hurry, I can always count on these potato products from Betty Crocker to make a hit without much of an effort on my part.

I recieved the delivery quicker than I thought I would. I was concerned with how the food item would be packaged. The Gyro slices were still frozen when I recieved them. The gyro slices were delicious, they taste better than most of the restaurants I frequent.

I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the "old" (with BPA) or the "new" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the "old" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!

Kona tastes just as great as always. I'm so glad to find a site that I can buy from and not be burned.

This tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade; it was totally dried out when I opened it.  When treacle sponge pudding dries, it smells nasty and can't be reconstituted, even with water and some heat.  Total waste of money.

Over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees - as well as the new chocolate flavor - do not understand why anyone would buy USED coffee - by its nature coffee cannot be USED

I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve

The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars).

I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all).

Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.

I could not find these in a store so I ordered them through Amazon.  If you want a healthy snack with just enough chocolate to kill the craving this is it.

These by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price. Low in calorie and a great after work out snack.

I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com

I love juice.  It is my favorite beverage.  Now this product adds a little zing to regular fruit juice.  It is ver refreshing and a great beverage.  Love the flavors.  Not sugary sweet but a little tart and with the carbonations a little zing.

This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical.

this item is over priced.  I but the 12oz pack "Sunsweet One California Prunes" individually wraped for $3.88 a bag (carried at most Walmarts).  If I buy 6bags @ $3.88, I spend only $23.28. i give the product rating a 5, but your charge if definitely over prices.  ~Gwen

I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.  Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.  I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.  So this product is all the good things rolled into one:  100% fruit juice No added sugar Bubbly Awesome orange flavor  It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy.

Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.  The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.  My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:  RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99  Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.  I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.
