This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont.

This Healthy Request version of Chunky Chicken Noodle is delicious. It tastes the same as the regular version, which isn't true of all of the varities of Healthy Request soup.   Before I start to warm the soup. I add a package of Ramen noodles, without the flavoring packet. The Ramen noodles absorb the chicken flavor of the liquid for a great taste. And makes for an inexpensive, and filling, complete meal that is quick and easy to prepare. With much less salt than the regular version.

I must confess that I bought this product only because I wanted to see the pretty flower blossom inside the water. To my surprise, it smells and tastes really good too! And the flower is very pretty, totally worth it!

I've had a hard time figuring out the right amount to use, but this product tastes great! It was shipped quickly & packaged well.

I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.

I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.

Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.

You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.  This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.  I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.  Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots.

This snack is good, really good. The flavors aren't overwhelming. The texture is nice, crispy and crunchy. This is great for those times when you need a little something to stop the craving.

This is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter. I even bake with it.  I make "peanut" butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product.  It's definitely not a "No-Stir" product though.  It does arrive separated.  The oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time.  This is still a fabulous product.  My children adore it.

I grew up on this juice in England. The lemon flavor was the original. Look for the orange and black currant......mmmmmm It is great. In the USA you don't tend to find what we call 'cordials' so much. It is a economical way of getting a great tasting juice. It is so concentrated, it goes a long way. I have a soda stream (again something I grew up with in the UK) and I make a lot of club soda with it. I then add a small amount of Barley water and it is so refreshing. I love it !!!

I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine-y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.  I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my "must buy" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them.

This is a great tasting product. It doesn't have any sugar. It flows just like honey!

It really does taste good!  I don't like to measure anything... So if you put in too much water, you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker.  Though, if you don't like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind, this might not be for you.

Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans. Cooked up great. Very pleased.

I received a free sample in with an order I'd placed on line, and thought "why not try it?"  Only 15 calories and NO artificial sweeteners, flavors or preservatives. OH MY. I'm hooked.  The grape flavor isn't weak like Kool-aid; it's just right. Not too tart, not too sweet.  This product also has electrolytes in it, so it will help keep my hydrated when I work out.

We decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house!  This was our first purchase of syrup, and we are so pleased with the quality.  It tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past.  The banana is delish, and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far!  Wonderful product!

The product was recieved in a timely manner. The product was in good condition and the item was in good shape.  Quality was good. Great price

I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.

I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now don't even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but it's not available.  Very Disappointed  Leona  The order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.  Transaction Date  11/03/2011 Location Amount  $20.94 Reference Number  [...] Description  Amazon.com AMZN.COM/BILLWA

I bought this with my hestitation however, it tastes good. it has a very butterly taste and sweet as well only 8 pieces not so many:(

I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter. So don't think gluten free means flavorless, this Bisquick Pancake Mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. It's so nice that these are healthier for you, diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too!

These are good but I think I was spoiled by the Blueberry flavor.  They are my favorite.  I like the whole line because they use better quality ingredients. These are delicious but I'd like more figs.

it arrived in a timely manor and in great shape... by ordering on line i saved close to $100 and couldn't be more happy

These are and will always be delicious! they are hard to find and was pleased to find it on amazon at a great price! best price found anywhere. my kids love the chocolate but the vanilla were even a better deal and of course also delicious! give it a try, you won't regret it!

I am a Kinder Chocolate fan from way back and it is hard to come by in the US. But this shipment was fresh and arrived timely. Way to go.

Good quality Rose Petal Powder at a very good price!  I'm using it as a face and body scrub, as well as a mask.  It can be used alone, or it mixes well into argan oil or any liquid soaps and lotions.  Also highly recommend the vendor; the shipment was exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable time.

I've always been a little anxious to purchase groceries online, but I gave it a shot with this product and I'm satisfied! Great price and awesome product. If you're worried about purchasing it, just try it. You won't regret it.

I was at Wal Mart today and compared pricing.  $1.83 a box for 12.2 oz.  It was around $2.80 at Wal-Mart for 18 oz in their store brand.  So the real deal is slightly cheaper and shows right up at the door.  Can't beat it.  I wish the prices were as good on other cereal on Amazon.  As a bonus, these boxes came with a Spider-Man movie ticket promotion.  So I ordered more to get free tickets for my family via the promotion.  Consider that, the cereal was almost free.

Our family LOVES these Cornuts! Delicious, fresh and crunchy.  We remember them from when we were kids and still can't get enough. We like all the flavors, but our favorite is still the original. After much research, this company offers the best price.

I have purchased GF oats from Bob's Red Mill and from Legacy Valley.  I store all my grains in the freezer so they should not become rancid once they are in my possession.  But the oats from Legacy Valley taste rancid, they have a very bitter after taste.  None of my kids will eat them and unfortunately I bought a whole case.  I do NOT recommend this product.  Buy Bob's Red Mill instead!

Very fresh tasting and refreshing. Better than any other brand I have tried. A good buy if you get it delivered on a regular basis. Short reviews not wanted by Amazon.

These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!  They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.  Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.  I love `em! Enjoy!

I love these!!!  Everyone with whom I have shared them agrees.  They are so satisfying I eat at least a bag a day.  I love the other crunchy cheese products but these are my favorite.

I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!

I really like all the power bars flavors.  Great for when you want a snack but don't want all the bad stuff that comes with other protein bars.  I also like the crunch. when I'm craving chocolate it really hits the spot and dulls my cravings.

Hi, I am very disappointed with the past shipment I received of the ONE coconut water. 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled.  Thanks.  Laks

Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.

taste like fruit. like the texture kinda like gummy bears.  love the calories, great snack and easy to travel with. had these before and this is 2nd order

I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.

I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.  When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a "test" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.  So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  "Icicle compatibility with Windows 7", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.  Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle "techs" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us "technical support", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.  I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.  If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.

I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.  However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.  Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?

This is a terrific training treat.  It smells absolutely wonderful, is not greasy, can be cut into small pieces and my dog LOVES it!  She'll perform every trick she knows just to get a morsel of it. When I take her for a walk and carry the treats in my pocket, I have her full attention. Highly recommended!

I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

It tastes great. I've only used it as a supplement and not in cooking. Also, Some people had given concerns over packaging, but mine was completely fine.

We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!

I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand, but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is "pickier," so he would prefer a meatier taste, but he does clean it up eventually.

awsome taste love the bold flavor and individual packging already drank them all will order them again and again rich taste wife loves the coffee

Nice for break fast. No bloated tummy,applely flavor.Enjoyed several breakfastes with the pan cakes. Good taste and texture.Yummy for kids too.

I love the regular version of this soup, and accidentally bought a case of the low-sodium version.  No amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product.

These are quality hot stuffed peppers. They are filled with tuna and anchovies and not bread crump fillers like almost all the other stuffed products. The quality pepper as well as stuffing makes the product stand out, and also explains the extra cost. A healthy product with unsaturated vegetable fat. Respectfully submitted.

I grew up in Portugal eating the real thing, fresh, grilled sardines, and these are very close to that.  They're the best that I have found in this country.  Highly recommend. PLus, it's great that they are in olive oil.

This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.

These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.

This quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added.....2 eggs and 1/2 cup of melted butter and water.  It cooks up fast and easy and tastes great.  It's a bit on the heavy side...sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it's truly enjoyable.  I would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so I wouldn't suggest daily intake of it.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it too.

I have been buying Garden of Life products for several years now and have tried other coconut oils but still come back to Garden of Life.  Even though it cost more than other brands it still taste the best.

This has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf.  i don't like drinking caffeine throughout the day.  I would recommend this as it's easy to carry with you in your purse, briefcase, or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water.  It only adds 5 calories though.  Great stuff.

This isn't as hot as some of the hot sauces I have tried. However, this one has the best taste for the scovel units. So this is the best bang for the heat and flavor combined. You will not find anything hotter with this kind of flavor. Great stuff.

Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off.

This Nustevia product is the best I have ever tried. There is no bitter taste. It is very sweet and only takes a few drops. On a previous review, I spoke about another product and how tasty it was. However, this one beats it by a long shot. I highly recommend it. I am glad I tried this one.

I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).  I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.  So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had.

I don't normally write reviews, I can't be bothered. The reason for this review is this pasta is fantastic. I have MS and it was recomended to me to do a gluten free diet. I'm Italian and pasta is important to Italians. I now enjoy pasta as before, this pasta tastes like regular pasta. I have recomended it to my friends that are on gluten free diets and they love it also. Try it you will never regret it.

I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.

Very tasty item, although I enjoy it more with some veggies, but overall great sauce, and quality product.

Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.

I actually liked the taste of this drink. I would drink it without the energy factor. The taste alone is the reason I give this product four stars. There are two servings in one can. I only drank one serving at a time. I could not detect any extra energy or alertness. I am a coffee drinker though. It does have caffeine in it, but not an excessive amount. Probably just the right amount so it doesn't give one the jitters. I liked it.

I've loved these since I was a kid, my mom has been giving them to me for Christmas ever since I discovered them.  Perfect amount of orange flavor blended in with delicious dark chocolate.  I had my boyfriend try these recently as well, he loves them too.  He has a mild milk allergy so he sometimes can't eat certain brands, but these don't bother him.

This little can packs a good punch!  Lots of flavor and a caffeine boost.  Apparently, all for just 100 calories (according to the can).  The flavor is very rich but not so rich that you can't finish it.  I drank it right from the can, as I probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can.  I poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent.  So if this is going to be your "on the road" solution, you might think again.  But, if you can enjoy it in a glass -- you won't be disappointed.  Good stuff!

I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.

Very hot, but smooth, great consistancy, for use with most Korean cusine. Just a dab will do, you don't want too much. This items is tasty, but extremely hot. Great side with most Korean dishes

I purchase the strawberry version of the Crystal Light Energy line usually, but decided to give peach mango a try.  It was very good!  I drink this stuff everyday, and having a different flavor was an excellent change.  120 mg of caffeine per packet, and all the water you can drink.  No more of that canned energy crap for me!

Haven't bought these from Amazon, but I do buy them from Trader Joes. These cherries are VERY good and the best part is that there is no sugar or other sweetener added (which is pretty hard to find). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the cherries are too dry and not that tasty, but the majority of the bag is delicious.

I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) "Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food." Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the "scientists" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.  update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.  5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track.

I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn't realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date.

Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!

I ordered these because I needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor. I had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually! I recieved exactly 4 broken suckers in the whole pack of 48. I didn't think that was bad at all for such a fragile product!

Order came promptly. We love this easy way to make a flavor addition to a number of our foods. Will likely try other products from this line. The food bloggers were right, very yummy.

I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.

A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.

Do not buy this product.  You will not be doing your infant any favors.  If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding.  (I know it's not always easy or convenient.)  If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then "fortify" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the "green" movement.  OH and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar!!! Good way to start the diabetes/obesity while they're young!

I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid ("It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick.  Each pouch is designed for 4-6 half inch thick bone-in or boneless chops.  It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water.  No messy clean up.  And the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended 15 minutes.  I used a thermometer to check for the recommended 160 degrees.  The flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty.  For a quick weeknight meal, I will buy this.

I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions...

My husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we HAD to try these!! Very quick and easy. Don't need anything but the meat. But you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner! :)

I may not be a culinary expert, but I know taste.  This basil has a more intense and better flavor than I had experienced with any other dried basil.  I highly recommend it.

I bought these in response to a 'Just For You!' recommendation and was very pleased.  The product was fresh and gummy, not stale at all.  I was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are.  I admire their tasty, tasty glow just before I pop them into my mouth.  I was home when the box arrived and, since it was a warm day, I was glad I was.  The bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm, so I popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while.  When they had cooled, I opened the bag -- it's not a resealable bag -- and divided the bears into 5 ziplocs, eating the ones that fell onto the counter for, ummmm, health and safety reasons.  Hopefully, this will keep them fresh a long while.

These were really good. I got them free to try and loved them. Very filling and tasty. Me and my husband shared it and we couldn't wait to buy more.

I needed to fill a giant pepper mill. I didn't know if this package would be enough. I had leftovers.

Nice aromas, wonderful exotic taste! Definately for people who like to sample exotic cuisines. Reminds me of being in southeast Asia. Love it!

This tea is very flavorful. The pyramidal tea bags seem to allow more flavor to infuse. I would buy this again.

I tried Congo Bongo in my friend's house, and absolutely love it. But since I prefer green tea, I've ordered Fiji. It has great taste, hope the quality of the tea also good. Love Fiji, and going to try some other flavor from SerendipiTea.

This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price.

I bought this tea to help my pregnancy, i think it may be helping..im hoping. but it does taste very good i like it and would buy it again and recommend this product to friends.

Not only is this tea delicious, but it's organic and very cheap! I've bought Rooibos from over 5 other stores, and it has never been this cheap or this good! Davidson's for the win

This is excellent green tea.  It is just a little spicy and very flavorful.  Green tea is so good for you, you won't even miss your morning coffee.  And..... you are helping children when you buy Tea District Children's Tribute tea.

Love this product. Highly recommended. This is now our 5th bottle. This is concentrate so it lasts a while. We mix with water or ice tea.

I am completely hooked on Lipton's glass size cold brew tea bags. The small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags.  Thank you Lipton!

When I'm in a hurry, I can always count on these potato products from Betty Crocker to make a hit without much of an effort on my part.

For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures.

For gluten free they are pretty good. They are a bit dry but that seems to be a problem with gluten free in general. I like the Simplebites line but I wish there were more varieties.

I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour.

I do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating, but I can't bring myself to enjoy them. I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just aren't setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. I'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend's family that are gluten free.

Our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1/2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth, not grainy.  I don't know that side-by-side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference!

I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it.

Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!

Current topic: coffee

This coffee . Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)  is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee.

This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.  So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!  This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.

I tried these out last weekend just as the temps have started to dip and I was not disappointed! I expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that I got neither! I was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too! This is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea. If I had to point out anything bad about them, maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet? If you brew it on your smallest cup setting (mine is 5oz for the Keurig B60 Special Edition) it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right.  I hate having to buy 2-packs though...

If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste.

I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. I finally ask myself why am I eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don't seem to like it much either.

I bought this for my hubby, he loves dark rich coffee & Dark Magic offers it. Great convenience of the Kcup makes it that much nicer.

THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.

I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.  I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.  Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can.
