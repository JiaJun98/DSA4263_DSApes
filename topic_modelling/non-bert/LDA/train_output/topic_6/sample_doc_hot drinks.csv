3794,This coffe was over priced and not a true French roast. I would not describe it as dark or bold in flavor.  Would have been helpful if a price per pod was added.
8,"I wish Gevalia came with an option for whole beans, but as pre-ground coffee goes, this makes a great Sunday morning treat. It may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee, but if you like candy-coffee, you will probably like this."
827,"I was pleased when Amazon decided to sell Community Coffee since I long ago decided it was the best of the rich, strong flavored Louisiana coffees.  The private reserve coffees Community Coffee sells are quite good, just as I remembered them being when I lived in Baton Rouge many, many years ago.  Community Coffees offer a consistently rich, flavorful roast.  The price is reasonable especially with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  I make my own blends of Sumatran, French Roast, Columbian and Espresso and am very happy with the results."
2048,The taste of these teas are great. but i added honey to make it a little more sweet.
2467,"I've been drinking peppermint tea for about 25 year. In fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch. To me, this tea tastes great, and has a good minty kick to it. I'd certainly purchase this again. I use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup I use. At this moment I am drinking a 20oz cup and the strength is good. I declare this a phenomenal value!"
