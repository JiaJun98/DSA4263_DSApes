2372,I was able to get a bottle for $1.00 through a relay for life food sale.  This is the best juice ever!
105,"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger ""house"" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.  I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat. I have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 525cs."
3463,"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable."
767,These biscuits are really good! I bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch. I think they are a lot better than Nutri grain bars and Quaker Oats granola bars. I've also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better. It's also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet: [...]/ or just Google Belvita coupons!
264,"These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon."
