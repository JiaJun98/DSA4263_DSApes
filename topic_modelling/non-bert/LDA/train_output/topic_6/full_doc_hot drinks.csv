2,I just brewed my first cup and the aroma and flavor both speak of autumn and harvest.  I LOVE the flavor.  I would highly recommend this herbal tea.,5
5,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.  I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.   When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.",5
8,"I wish Gevalia came with an option for whole beans, but as pre-ground coffee goes, this makes a great Sunday morning treat. It may be a little rich for some people as an everyday cofffee, but if you like candy-coffee, you will probably like this.",5
18,I drink a lot of teas and tisanes so I like to try different kinds from time to time. I've been drinking this for a few weeks and it's fantastic. Even before I brewed this I knew it was going to be good just from the aroma. (Actually it would make a great potpourri on its own.) It brews up a nice deep color with a good flavor. I highly recommend this.,5
26,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.  But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate.",5
30,Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.  I do like my coffee a little on the strong side and can use the pod to make a very big cup of coffee before tossing.  I would recommend this product.,5
35,"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!",5
46,I'm grateful for my Keurig coffee maker!  The taste of Green Mountain brand Dark Magic is terrific & got used up real fast!,5
52,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.",5
75,I love the strength and taste of PG Tips. I grew up in England drinking this tea - and when I came to America in 2001 I just could not drink the weak tasteless tea that was being sold on the supermarket shelves - I have introduced my wife and friends to this tea - they now can't drink anything else!,5
76,I was looking for all natural flavored coffee (not easy to find) when my college aged son brought some of this home. I could not find it locally at grocery stores or Starbucks locations so I'm glad it's available at amazon. It has a mild vanilla flavor- not overwhelming like some of the artificially flavored coffees. I will continue to order it.,5
87,We love the Hazelnut coffee in our house! Great flavor and the coffee isn't bitter or too strong. I also love the price! Buying it here in a pack of 50 makes it cheaper than any of the stores in our city.,5
94,Great strong tasting gum BUT doesn't last long BUT is still worth it especially if your not allowed to have regular sf gum! The cinnamon taste is very great!,5
97,This tea has a wonderful taste of blueberry.  It's even wonderful iced as a treat for family and guests alike.  Everyone who I have surved it to has loved it.,5
103,"I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.  Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.  This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.  They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.  Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these.",5
111,"I drink a LOT of tea. I probably drink around 14 cups a day, and I drink the good stuff. All whole leaf, quality, loose-tea. So I know a good cup of tea when I see one.  These are the ONLY bottles of tea that are of FANTASTIC quality.  Ito-En makes amazing stuff, and this is my absolute favorite tea from them. The price is excellent and the drink is SO healthy; I have it delivered once a month, every month.  HIGHLY recommended. :)",5
119,"I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club.",5
123,"I have tried a number of Senseo pods, and this is my favorite.  It is very smooth.  It tastes like coffee from a coffee house (rather than a Senseo).",5
127,"I think this is a great tasting product,use in coffee every day.I am saying goo-bye to white sugar!!",5
133,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.  When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).  For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.",5
135,"Works well, taste is good, about to order a new box.  If you are a diabetic this is nice to have around the house or office.",5
139,"Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it.  Great idea, just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it.",5
143,"I've been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites. Something strange happens in the packing because flavour differs a lot from one box to another: the one I'm tasting right now has a lot of cinnamon, while others have a better balance of ingredients. Eventhough they all are great teas and the 5 star rating suits them well.",5
148,"this has a great taste, is good on mufins or toast, also great on vanilla ice cream. excellent! Will buy again",5
150,"Fantastic espresso beans!  I usually drink Illy, but thought I would give this a 'shot'... and I was not disappointed! This has a slightly smokier flavor than the Illy roasts, produces a NICE crema, and is ultra smooth.  In short, give this a try.  Highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there...",5
168,"If any of you read Kim Harrison - you will know that Al always orders a latte with raspberry syrup and extra cinnamon.  I tried this drink at Starbucks and it was wonderful.  I have an espresso machine at home and thought I could save a lot of time and money making this drink on my own.  This syrup was perfect!  It tastes wonderful, both in my coffee and also on ice cream!",5
176,"My wife likes flavored coffee and this is, by far, her favorite. Great taste. Medium brew. Excellent value too. We order this brew regularly. Guests enjoy this coffee as wel.",5
194,"If this was called ""Medium Roast"", I would give it 4 stars. It's a good coffee.  But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the product's name.  Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if it's vanilla or caramel, I love it.  With the exception of this.  Where's the vanilla? Where's the caramel? And don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. I'm saying that they are NON-EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star.",5
195,We have been paying big bucks for little cans of Rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon. I was surprised that the Davidson's Rooibos was richer and tastier and brewed up a nice clear amber/brown color. Better quality and less expensive!,5
201,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes.",5
203,"This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!  As with many food items sold on Amazon, I would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer (if you can find it) before committing to a whole six-pack. Once you know you like it, however, the value of this offering really can't be beat anywhere!",5
205,Grove Square Cappuccino Cups were excellent. Tasted really good right from the Keurig brewer with nothing added.  wWould highly recommend.  RCCJR,5
207,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.  So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.  This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.  Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]  Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those ""You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone"" sorts of things, I guess.  Happy brewing!",5
209,I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.  The peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the English Breakfast Tea made me a fan of that flavor where I never had been before.  I'll be watching for other tea collections from Bentley's.,5
211,"Like most coffee drinkers, I know Kona is a special coffee bean, and this brand offers great taste. At my local coffee shop, I often pick Kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day. While the coffee shop Kona is better than an average coffee, it did not seem to be anything special, and I could guess they do not sell true Kona, but a blend.  So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters.  I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had.  The flavor is strong and there is no after-taste issue.  I picked the medium roast and I plan to try the dark roast next.",5
215,"This is my very favorite tea!  It has a nice, strong  blackberry taste.  A must-try for berry lovers like me.",5
221,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!",5
222,Have been getting this coffee for several months and very much like their bold flavor in comparison to others I've tried. Keep it air tight after opening is not a big deal. great coffee!,5
230,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing.",5
241,"I expected the flavor to be more like that of ""brewed"" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again.",5
248,"I've long been a fan of the Maxwell House International Coffee line, so I was excited to try this flavor.  If you are a fan of other pumpkin spice drinks at unnamed large coffee chains, you will definitely like this product.  I like that you are able to add the amount that you want, and the mix blends very nicely and evenly.  This is a perfect treat for a cold winter's night!",5
251,"We didn't like the taste of this sort. We are from Europe, American style coffee isn't what we like.  After this we tried ""Coffee Bean Direct Brazilian Santos, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag"", this was much better.",5
253,"If you like coffee with overtones of nuts, and are fond of pecans, you need to try this coffee. Mrs. Bryants Southern Pecan Organic coffee is a real treat with a genuine pecan flavoring. Try some with a slice of you favorite pecan pie!",5
259,"This is by far the best tea I have ever had to drink.  I purchased my first cup at a Barnes and Nobles and could not wait to get home to find the tea on the internet and order.  Try it, if you like cinnamon you will love this tea.  Great hot or cold.",5
278,This is one of my fav flavors so far. Do not let the word CREAM fool you. There is very little cream to these but they are still very flavorfull. I add either French Vanilla powdered cream or liquid cream to this and it's great. I have it on a regular basis. The flavor does not get old or eventually give you an aftertaste.,5
279,I usually get orange and spice tea (not decaf)for hot tea and I was not sure about these flavors but I LOVE THEM and they are caffeine free! These will make great stocking stuffers for Christmas too!  I'm going to have to order more soon!,5
282,Not nearly as good tasting as the other kcup ciders I've had. My girlfriend hated it too. They are going to find the garbage can.,5
285,"Uncle purchase K-Cup Keurig brewer for my office.  My staff and I love it.  No arguments about who is going to clean up the coffee at the end of the day.  Who is to blame for not turning it off and coffee burning at the bottom of the jug.  Plus we can have a selection of different coffees to suite the tastes for anyone.  We love it.  The Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is a very flavorful, but not a strong coffee.  I prefer the ""Jet-Fuel"" brand, but for the tamer coffee drinkers in the office they swear by it.",5
289,I am not a coffee drinker because I dont like the taste. Cafe Mocha tastes great. Now I can warm up and wake up.,5
290,My mother in law received this tea in as a gift for Christmas and I had a cup and it was delicious.  It was in sealed packets.  This tea is in paper packets like Lipton tea and does not taste any thing like my mother in laws.  Don't be disappointed like I am and save your money and do not buy this product.  Unfortunately I had to open the package to see and taste this so I could not return it.  I would give it no stars but I had to give it one to post.,5
315,Shipping was fast. The taste is great and reminds me of drinking from a real chilled green coconut on the sidewalk in Thailand.,5
316,"Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.",5
321,"Like other reviewers, I had low expectations for this gum, but was happily wrong.  I love key lime pie, and lime flavor in general.  When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.  Once that fades, the gum has a mellow, subtle, lime zest flavor.  I really like this gum.",5
323,I purchased their Matcha Green Tea Powder Cafe Grade a while back and I fell in love with it. Their powder comes in this little cute reusable tin. The taste of the tea is smooth and not bitter.  I make green tea milkshakes and it is the best that I have purchased. I highly recommend it.  I wish they offer their cafe grade powder in a bigger can. I use to work in a cafe where we had green tea powder in foil bags and they didn't seal well and when we opened the bag we would be covered in green powder and it was such a waste. Plus I really like the tin and want it in a bigger size.,5
329,"If you are a coffee lover, this is the way to go. Grind these fresh beans and make a full strong coffee that is delicious!",5
332,"I drink a couple of cups of strong black coffee every day but rarely a fancy drink from a cafe.  This product is convenient- you can just put it in the refrigerator or open the can and pour it over ice - or both. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It has plenty of caffeine and the right amount of milk and sugar.  I have had a very similar product from Starbucks and I really don't sense much of a difference between the two. I would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time. Again, this product and the product from Starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality.",5
333,I came home from a hot morning in the Arizona sun and opened my illy issimo coffee drink nice and cold from the fridge. I found the expresso taste strong but refreshing and the amount of sweetness just right. Great Product.,5
337,"I'm not generally a huge fan of Keurig coffee makers because they and their K-cups are so expensive. But my girlfriend has one and she ran out of coffee for it. I looked around Amazon and found this item. It sounded promising so I decided to try it. It is the best K-cup of coffee I've ever had (it has a strong, mellow medium roast flavor). And it's also the least expensive I've found. I signed up for a subscription and will probably keep it going. Yum.",5
338,"For fans of black licorice and Ouzo/Oghi, this candy is for you. Very natural tasting and a nice and interesting change from the usual mint. My grandmother got a pack and quickly needed me to buy 6 more, as we haven't been able to find a store that carries it in town",5
341,"I usually order this product from the actual Gevalia site because this flavor is quite yummy.  I also order the Cafe Sperl, which is also known as Viennese coffee.  When you first open the bag, the nose is tickled with the pungent smell of chocolate and a lighter aroma of raspberry.  The coffee tastes unique because of the raspberry flavoring, but it's enjoyable either freshly brewed or chilled.",5
356,"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.",5
366,"I really love herbal tea, especially honey and vanilla. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it.",5
369,"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it.",5
375,I got a box of this tea from a bed and bath and beyond kind of store and really liked it so I came here to buy more expecting a good price on a larger box.  $1 a cup?  And a k-cup isn't even an 8-oz cup?!  Nuts.  You can get a box of 108 from a certain B wholesale J warehouse club for $48.99...45 cents each!  The tea was surprising good for not really 'brewing' but buy it elsewhere cheaper!,5
377,I love simply love it.  It's organic.  It's inexpensive.  It has a wonderful flavor.  This is great hot or cold.,5
379,This is an great green tea choice if you like a blend of different teas.  I thought it was well-balanced and tasted great overall.,5
381,"I recommend this instead for the same price:  Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Milk Chocolate, 16-Count Envelopes (Pack of 8)   This thing falls short, I found myself adding some milk or my non-dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy.  It more or less tastes horrible otherwise.  After I hated it, I decided to make it with a cup of hot milk, I just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk, and it tastes so much better.  In my opinion, they need to up the powdered milk in them, or the non-dairy creamer in them.  It would improve this product so greatly.  They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.  I really thought I was buying quality, this is definitely not unless I use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money.  I've drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this.  AVOID!",5
385,"This coffee doesn't necessarily have brand cachet, but it's as good as other coffee I've bought at 2x the price.",5
389,"What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it, but you don't know until you've tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale, without any fruity characteristic of peaberries, and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.  The worst part is I am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned (Amazon does not accept return of food items).",5
396,"My husband and I have each tried drinking this coffee a few times and it tastes bad, a real chemical/artificial taste.  Do not recommend it.  We are throwing away the rest of it, which I don't like to do, but I wouldn't try to pass it off on a friend.",5
405,"I was apprehensive of buying a flavord coffee, I had a bad run-in with a cinnamon flavored coffee recently. This pumpkin spice coffee is very tasty. It smells good and it leaves my dorm room with a plesant aroma. The only downside to this coffee is it is a very light roast.",5
410,"Mixed with ice water, this has a great taste.  For those of you having grown up in Europe, the taste will bring back memories.",5
420,I liked this a lot and will keep this in my tea stock.  The Bergamot is strong and compliments the full bodied earl grey tea well.,5
423,"I am not a coffee drinker, but tea is what wakes me up in the morning. This is a great black tea, with a wonderful flavor.  I french press it to bring out the flavor, this loose leaf tea is perfect for this.  I have never enjoyed a cup of tea more than this one.",5
425,My husband worked for this Oreintal family who gave him a 48 oz package of  NOH Hawaiian Iced Tea . He raved on how good it was . I didnt believe him until I actually tried it . UMMMM great cool taste and refreshing Ice tea . I would definetely recommend,5
434,this is the best coffee if you like a strong cup. a real wake me up,5
437,"For those of you who drink coffee black, i think you are going to love this blend of coffee. It is very delicious and has a great bold flavor.",5
438,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes. This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.",5
449,"I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.  Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.  It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.  [...]",5
455,"Some similar kinds of flavored coffees have a subtle mint flavor. This is powerful stuff.  In a good way, of course.  It had a very powerful taste of chocolate mint, very fulfilling.  Much better tasting than similar products.  I highly recommend this.",5
459,I got this tea a few days ago and it has great taste...has a mild citrus taste. Love love love! Will come back in 4 weeks to review the weight loss aspect as today is my first day!  Update (almost 2 weeks later): I am still totally in love with this tea and I actually noticed that it suppresses appetite. Great! I have been losing weight but I can't totally attribute it to this tea as I have also been exercising more. But the appetite suppression is a great attribute for me.,5
463,"This tea has the real flavor of pumpkin.  It is nicely spiced and perfect for an autumn afternoon.  It is quite highly caffeinated so I do not drink it late at night.  But overall, a lovely tea.",5
467,"I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage.",5
471,"It tastes great, dissolves just fine, and provides the jolt I need to start my day.",5
472,I had expected the peach tea to taste like peach and it does not.  Very disappointed.,5
496,"This coffee was delicious! I actually purchased it as a gift, but since I paid $30 for 1 lb of coffee, I tasted the freakin coffee!  It was so good! I meant to purchase the light roast, but accidentally ordered the medium. It was full bodied and delicious, totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees. I can't afford 100% pure Kona all the time and normally buy blends, but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then.",5
498,"What a great thing to wake up to....I feel these k-cups are of medium strength, with just enough of Kahula..",5
510,"Really enjoyed ordering and using this coffee. Reminds me of expresso in coffee shops throughout italy. I've never really used pre-packed coffee before as I've always preferred freshly ground. However, this taste fresh and yummy. Great head, not bitter, but still has good depth. Will continue to order every time I need more coffee.  [...]",5
517,I just made myself a cup of this coffee and I think I found a new favorite brand. When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar. I really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness. Definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee.,5
518,"I really liked this a change up from strictly white tea.  Very expensive though, so will only order every once in awhile as a treat.",5
519,Needless to say these cookies didn't last long once they were opened. They reminded my wife of the Tagalongs the Girl Scouts used to sell.  Very smooth fudge coating and that oh-so-lovely Oreo crunch. I could eat these all day.  Viva la Oreo!,5
523,"I am a huge peppermint lover!  I am also a bit of a picky person when it comes to drink mixes.  For me, many end up being powdery and not as creamy and tasty as I would like.  That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate.",5
525,THE COFFEE MAKER WORKS FINE. I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE TASTE OF THE COFFEE. IT TASTES TOO MUCH LIKE INSTANT.,5
539,I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.,5
544,"If you love the flavor of toasted pecans, this coffee is for you.  Great flavor, good coffee taste.  It was very easy to brew the right strength. What a pleasure to wake up to the smell of toasted pecans and freshly brewed coffee! This is the second time I've purchased this coffee and I'll definitely do it again.",5
545,"To see all the one-star reviews is quite surprising. Mixed with water, this stuff tastes great. I'm not sure what some reviewers are expecting, but it does taste like a good glass of kool aid. Who doesn't like kool aid??? Anyway, it's main source that will keep you alert is the green tea extract, which is pretty much caffeine. But it's a smooth transition somehow, not like drinking coffee or soda. Anyway, not bad at all if you need a little pick me up. Got lots of vitamins in there too.",5
548,I can't get decaf at the stores here and love this tea.  I am now well supplied and can share a box or 2 with friends.  You can make it with just water or for a special treat use 1/2 milk.  Add some honey and top with whipped cream - very decadent!  The price is very good and I got free shipping.,5
560,"I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.  I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.  But I add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good.",5
571,"This is a much better tasting instant tea than anything else Lipton currently makes.  It is not as convenient coming in the big jar vs. the individual packets but the taste is well worth it.  Lightly sweet, with just a hint of tea.  Highly recommend!!",5
575,This tea is truly from the highlands in Kenya and tastes great.  It is refreshing with a great flavor.  The packages was delivered on time and intact. We usually drink tea (with milk) in the evening and this tea adds to the relaxation after a long day.,5
598,"I tried couple of green tea but I like this green tea very much, great taste sweet smell will order more soon :)",5
599,"I saw this tea from my friend's room and asked for a couple. She has the Super Slimming tea and the Detox tea. I usually combine the two. It made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual, but I feel much relieved like more refreshed. My pimples went away and my back acne is non-existent. The store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand, sucks! I have to purchased it on-line now.",5
604,"My daughter and I love the taste of Big Train Vanilla Chai, it isn't too spicy like other Chai's can be.",5
606,If you use the Dolce Gusto machine Amazon is the place to buy the coffee. You'll get the best price and super fast shipping. And if you setup a subscription for the coffee you'll even get a better price!,5
618,Lipton French Vanilla is hands down one of the most delicious black teas available - I am thankful I can continue to purchase it through Amazon since it is no longer available in stores.,5
619,"Took a while to arrive and the box was kind of dingy, but it was well worth the wait.  Nice kick for coffee, sugar free ice cream, and as flavored sweetener.",5
622,"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back.",5
629,"I like strong coffee, but I don't want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. Caribou Coffee's Mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity.  It's one of my ""go to"" coffees when my favorites like Coffee People's Wake Up Call are out of stock.",5
631,"I love chai and the price was right so I bought this thinking, ""how different could it be from the Celestial Seasonings spiced chai I bought recently?""  Big difference, this tea has no flavor.",5
635,"I absolutely love this cappuccino! I had my doubts, but they were proved wrong! I myself have a sweet tooth and I was worried that this product would taste too much like coffee and not enough like a cappuccino. But thankfully, I was worng and it had the right blend of both. I had 2 cups the first day I bought it! Shared it with my family, they loved it too!",5
636,"This is my wife's brand of choice for decent, not too expensive espresso.  It's hard to find in stores around here, so buying on Amazon is a really nice option, especially with Prime.",5
640,"The taste of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is so wonderful.  As soon as it begins to brew, you can smell it throughout the kitchen.  The taste is deep, rich, and sweet!",5
642,No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good,5
666,"I've loved this tea eversince Starbucks sold it in select stores. Now that they've stopped I needed to find it elsewhere. Please continue to sell Tazo Lotus Green Tea, as it is hard to find, and very much appreciated. Very quick and excellent shipping. Thanks again!",5
671,this is a really good thing to do if you drink coffee and use creamer. The price with subscrib & save saves you almost a 1.00 a container. try it you'll like it and its deliveried to you,5
676,"I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat.",5
687,"Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!",5
711,"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as ""coffee tasting"" or with ""roasted flavors,"" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor.",5
712,"The coffee itself is great, but how can Amazon be charging $20.05 for a 24 count box when MSRP is $13.95 and you can find it at specialty shops for around $11.00?",5
717,Taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite. Basically if the price is good go for it.,5
729,Not much to say- good stuff.  Amazon's grocery concept is great and I look forward to ordering more.  Now if only they offered Coffee-mate's Vanilla Chai Spice creamer.  That is some amazingly delicious powder right there.  Try it if you haven't yet!,5
733,"First of all, I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K-Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups, paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them, I was already in the hole. If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you, because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out. I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them.",5
741,"Great tasting tea, with or without stevia. I drink it hot and cold. Product arrived very quickly. I have 1 or 2 cups daily.  I probably should have ordered 2 boxes!",5
744,"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!",5
747,"Those who label this as weak and  tasteless must be used to drinking straight espresso because this is very good tasting coffee and not weak at all. Although sometimes I question amazon reviews generally...  This is a delicious cup of coffee not to strong not too weak (I tend to lean towards strong coffee personally). I do have 1 complaint though, It did not seem to brew a larger cup than that of my other t discs, I really doubt if that is 12 ounces.  That being said I prefer this to my Starbucks blend t discs. Starbucks is a slight bitter in comparison, this is richer and a perfect middle ground between dark and light brew with terrific flavor!",5
751,"I've been drinkin this coffee for about three months, and in my opinion it is the best coffee I've ever tasted!!! I used to wake up with headaches almost every morning and now the aches are gone, I have LOST weight about 10 pounds....10 POUNDS! and what I really like about this coffee is that if I don't drink it for a couple of days I wont get those ""I need cafeine"" headaches in the morning.",5
755,I love this green tea. It has a wonderful brown rice flavor that makes it very tasty. I highly recommend it.,5
768,"As always this tea was quite tasty...but it was delivered to a home a block away that is vacant so I had to retrieve it...highly recommend the tea, use it alone but sparingly...or mix it with a black tea to mellow the flavor...",5
770,"Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!",5
773,I have had the illy issimo coffee before and liked it so I was excited to try this iced coffee drink. This cappuccino has a nice smooth taste with just enough sugar to make it sweet (but not overwhelming). It gave me a nice jolt of energy to get me through the afternoon but not leave me jittery. I will buy this again!,5
780,"I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!",5
781,Brewing this coffee took me back to my trip to Kona and visiting the coffee plantations.  Drinking a cup of this brew is the next best thing to being there!,5
784,"Very clean and light. 0 calories.  I've only used it in coffee, but it would probably be good over ice cream too. My friend joked you could put it in the bath, but I think that actually might be a good idea. Haven't tried it yet, but since it's made with Splends, not sugar, you probably could get a nice peppermint bath!  Haha. Weird. As a coffee flavor it is very nice!  By the way, the bottles are plastic, not glass, in case you were wondering.",5
787,I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didn't taste like the original but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  I'm upset still.,5
788,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.  ~The Rebecca Review",5
791,Did not like flavor.  Left significant residue in cup and flow was limited into cup.  Tried 2 and plan to return.  Very disappointing,5
798,"I love Nescafe Taster's Choice coffee.  I had been using the Gourmet Roast, but when my blood pressure became slightly elevated, I switched to the Decaf.  It is delicious, and my blood pressure is now behaving.  I love being able to buy this product for such a fair price.",5
800,"i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu-erh's fermentation process.  But I am so glad that i didn't let all of that discourage me.  This is a very smooth, rich, full-bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee.  It definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day.  I used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed!!  What makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item!!",5
815,"Unfortunately, I'm much too frugal to throw away something I've spent perfectly good money on, so I'm continuing to use these suckers until they're gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent brand of coffee, given the Wolfgang Puck name, but alas, I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and it's marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldn't serve these to guests EVER. I can't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please don't waste your money.",5
817,"Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many ""Gourmet Coffees"" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for.",5
827,"I was pleased when Amazon decided to sell Community Coffee since I long ago decided it was the best of the rich, strong flavored Louisiana coffees.  The private reserve coffees Community Coffee sells are quite good, just as I remembered them being when I lived in Baton Rouge many, many years ago.  Community Coffees offer a consistently rich, flavorful roast.  The price is reasonable especially with Amazon's subscribe and save program.  I make my own blends of Sumatran, French Roast, Columbian and Espresso and am very happy with the results.",5
835,"I typically go for breakfast blends, but this coffee simply tastes bad. I'd recommend trying some variety packs rather than buying one big pack as I did.",5
844,"I drink coffee in the morning for the kick. I ordered this coffee because the low-acid twist intrigued me. Promptly forgot about that aspect until it was time to reorder, which was sooner than expected because I started enjoying a second cup per day.  Yes, there's definitely something to the low-acid, as my stomach can tolerate two cups per day. But, I want that second cup due to the coffee's taste!  Quite flavorful, with good depth.",5
858,"I received a jar of this Instant Espresso as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I was quite ""insulted"" at first, as I've never used instant coffee of any kind and couldn't figure out why she gave it to me! Then this past weekend, I was out of coffee beans & this was all I had (must have coffee in morning).  So I made it, & WOW, it was awesome!! In fact, I'm drinking a mug of it right now as I right this review! I LOVE IT!!  However, I make it in more of a latte fashion.  I've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte.  I'll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores, and if I can't find it, I'll be getting it here on Amazon. Definitely a great buy!!",5
860,This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas. I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my (orange juice based) smoothie in the morning - it adds a nice hint of mint.  I recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea - this tea goes very well with orange juice.,5
879,"Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!",5
892,I love the taste of this green tea. It has a natural sweet mango taste and not the bitterness of plain green tea. I use 5 bags to make a pot.  Great tasting and good for you!,5
903,"I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.  After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.  What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.  I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.  Enjoy  Ken",5
906,"Medium/light roast you can really smell and enjoy the aroma of high quality arabica.  If you are a fan of medium/light roast you will enjoy this coffee.  Smooth, no burning flavor.",5
907,"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands.",5
936,"This syrup tastes very good.  Not quite as good as Starbucks, but comes close.",5
937,"I love Sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these K-Cups however was disappointed when I opened my Amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of K-Cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup... after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible I opened the first box and all cups were fine, however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and I had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere. I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good.",5
941,"Carnation Instant Breakfast, Classic French Vanilla, No Sugar Added, 8-Count Packets (Pack of 4)My husband has used powdered Carnation Instant Breakfast French Vanilla for 40+ years and says that it is the best drink he has each day.  He has developed Diabetes and changed to the sugar free mix and likes it as well, if not better.  His blood sugar has gone down and we seem to be able to maintain it now.  We are so glad that he can still have his ""best drink of the day""!!",5
954,"When I order the beans I had opened the lid and the seal was already broken like it had been pushed in and I didn't want to eat them nor give them to my husband. So I had contacted the seller through Amazon and they said Throw them away and we will send you a new batch and they did just that no hassle and no problem and they shipped pretty fast. These beans very very good compared to some. We are coffee lovers and Dark chocolate lovers so we had to try this pair and glad we did. Oh did i mention it has a real coffee bean? LOL some that we have tried was like ground coffee bean bits not the whole bean. so over all good price, quality and the amount and it is yummy :)",5
956,"As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good.",5
962,"My wife and I have been eating these for over a year and really like them. We slightly prefer them to Newman's Own, but of course that's personal taste.",5
963,"These flakes are smaller than I expected for something called ""large,"" but they taste great straight out of the package.  Throw them in your hot or cold cereal, on top of ice cream, or mix them into yogurt.  They're a sweet, crunchy, healthy treat!",5
984,"It is not worth the money.It does have a terrible taste.I bought one so far and stopped buying it and threw the unused coffee in garbage. If you want a good tasting instant coffee try Nescafe Classic or Nescafe Gold, available everywhere on earth but parts of the US.",5
985,I add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great.  It tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when I get a cappuccino there.,5
990,This is a tad better to me than the Mojito flavor. It's final mix is a translucent green. It's not too sweet but doesn't have that totally artificial-tasting twang to it either. I would definitely buy on my own.,5
997,"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.",5
1003,"I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc.  This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest.  It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).  I found it superior to the other Melitta products I've tried as well as to other much-vaunted brands such as Starbucks, Seattle's Best, and Gevalia.  But taste is on the tongue of the beholder...",5
1006,"Based on the reviews, I ordered a 6 pack of these.  BAD IDEA. We have tried a number of different varieties of pods,  these are by far the worst. This stuff is so bad no one here will drink it. You might want to buy one bag and try it before ordering a 6 pack.",5
1010,I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!,5
1016,"Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half).",5
1018,"I really love herbal tea, especially orange and mandarin. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it.",5
1027,"I have been looking everywhere for apple cider k cups.  Decided to check out amazon, and low and behold here they are.  They taste great, but as someone else mentioned they are a bit pricey.",5
1028,"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.  I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else.",5
1029,"This particular flavor of Folger's gourmet coffee didn't turn out to be my favorite in their Gourmet line, but it was pretty good nonetheless. All of their flavors are good.",5
1034,"We love hot apple cider and this was no exception! My 9 year old drank 6 cups the very first day I got this.  It has a wonderful, fresh apple taste with just the right amount of spice.  We will be ordering this on a regular basis!",5
1039,"I discovered Ambrosia custard while in Ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture.  Ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar, and the taste better than Birds, imo.  I would like to be able to purchase it in the aseptic boxes sold in the UK but am happy it's available at Amazon.",5
1047,"For those who do not drink coffee, this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your Keurig.",5
1048,"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.",5
1052,"I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the ""sweet"" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!",5
1066,This apple cider is very flavorable and really hits the spot. I am very happy with this purchase and plan on buying this product again.,5
1075,"My husband and I are coffee and tea freaks!  We'll try just about anything once.  I really like this tea, even if it's not Christmas.  Very smooth, the mint finish is very nice.  The ginger note is subdued, and not overpowering as I thought it might be.  Well worth trying at least once.",5
1077,"I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars. The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.  At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!  Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!",5
1079,I've been drinking the mocha CLICK on a daily basis for almost 2 years now and was VERY excited to hear a new flavor was coming out.  The vanilla CLICK is very good and a good option if you don't like the slightly thicker consistency of the mocha CLICK.  I'll be ordering both flavors each month from now on.,5
1083,"While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.  In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.",5
1089,"I don't think you can beat the value of this coffee, especially with the Subscribe and Save program! It is also a great French Roast with a full, deep flavor. It does not taste burnt like some of the Starbucks varieties, but is smooth and a little smokey. I like strong coffee, and so this is definitely the way to go for me. I've had compliments from visitors to our house on how good the coffee is, as well. I'm completely satisfied!",5
1092,I used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting.,5
1095,"I looked a long time for dark roast decaf that tasted like this one does.The package doesn't say where it is grown, but it tastes like Columbian beans to me. I hope Amazon keeps handling it. GREAT COFFEE, Gerald",5
1106,"Coffee was burnt, had a bad aftertaste, and very acidic.  note sure if a bad batch but this was not good coffee.",5
1112,"I bought this on whim one day while shopping. The unusual flavor interested me. When I popped it, the wonderful smell of lime filled the kitchen. The taste is great! Not over powering but refreshing & tasty. This would go great on a summer day or night with margaritas or beer. Great new flavor! Would never have thought of adding lime to popcorn but it works!",5
1120,Looking for great coffee at a great price?  This is it. K-cups are expensive but this coffee is great tasting at a great price when purchased from Amazon,5
1129,No complaints whatsoever. This is a tasty coffee drink. The coffee is strong and good and the sweetener is perfect - just sweet enough without being that kind of sickly sweet that mars something like Starbucks' pre-made iced coffee drinks. Just about perfect. Refreshing and a nice boost for the afternoon.,5
1131,If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one. My second joice would be the Starbucks Italian blend.,5
1134,"Tasty coffee.  Works well in drip coffee maker.  Smooth taste and nice flavor.  Remember it's preground, so don't expect fresh ground, recently roasted bean taste.  But it's a lot more convenient.",5
1135,"I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product.",5
1136,"I usually purchase the Green Mountain Naturals Apple Cider.  I found this product was much cheaper and I would try it.  From now on, I will spend the extra for a taste I enjoy.  This went down the sink!",5
1137,"I enjoy this tea plain, with honey, or with a splash of milk. The ingredients are simple and natural;  no soy lecithin, no so called natural flavorings.  Very difficult to find herbal tea in the market place that doesn't have junk added to cheap it out.  My children enjoy this tea warm with honey during the winter.  Iced during the summer with a hint of sugar and a wedge of lemon.  Ingredients: Hibiscus, cinnamon, Ginger, peppermint, orange peel, rose hips, rose petals",5
1142,I am not much of a fan of Amaretto.  I followed the advice from other reviewers (purchased the variety pack and tried them all).  The Amaretto and Vanilla flavors are my favorites.  I normally don't drink flavored coffee but that is about to change.  I am so glad to have found this caffeine free option so that I can continue to enjoy a cup or two in the morning.  I really suggest you order the variety pack first and find out what suits your taste.,5
1144,"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee.",5
1155,"I bought this green tea because it is organic. I knew I was getting a healthy product but what I got was much more. The taste is really good. It is fresh, smooth and full bodied. You will be pleased with this high quality tea. What a nice surprise. Note: This Bigelow product comes 40 bags to a box and 4 tea bags to a wrapper.",5
1158,"With  Green Mountain Hot Cocoa  being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.  Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.  Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.  As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or "" Splenda "" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.  If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.",5
1163,it is hard to believe the instant coffee can have the same taste as brewed one.,5
1164,"Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.  I guess I'll just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine!",5
1172,"This does not taste at all like ""cough syrup"" as the other reviewer stated.  This is the best gum out there and I highly recommend it.  I am not a plant, I live in Austin, TX and bought a pack of this in San Antonio - I just ordered a box on Amazon.  This and the Lemon are the best flavors Orbit makes.  John",5
1173,"We have tried many different whole bean french roast coffees. This is one of the better we have tasted. The fact that it is fair trade, organic and shade grown is a bonus",5
1176,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in  Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two  and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)  I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas.",5
1181,"Lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea! If you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust (cheep). Even the loos lipton tea is described as being ""broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it."" When you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach!  They say this tea comes to $0.57 an oz?!?!?! Lets do the math. $27.54 devided by 8oz = $3.44. I buy my tea from Set to a Tea [...]). It's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices. It comes to $3 an oz for a tin or $2.57 for a refill. Weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea! I went to a tea party last year (like a tupperware party but more fun) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples.",5
1189,"The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green, dry and somewhat stale, they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have!",5
1202,"I've ordered several davidson's tea and they have all been exception. Except this order of decaf green tea tasted like rotten tea, maybe I just got a bad bag.",5
1208,"Loved the depth of flavor in the vanilla flavored starbucks coffee.  I really loved that the rich coffee could still be tasted through the flavoring, the vanilla complimenting rather than overpowering.  Tastes like a true vanilla bean, not just sugary syrup.  I only wish that starbucks, and everyone else who has flavored coffee, would include nutrition facts on the side.  Not sure why coffee doesn't see to have to, but I wish they would.",5
1217,"I have been buying this for years, it has always been two boxes of 50 pods each for the $59.98. Recently the price has doubled to one box of 50 pods for $59.98. Greed. I have been forced to shop for other brands and surprising I do like the other brands.",5
1229,I have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results.  U-Roast-Em is the exception. I have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them.  They provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices.  They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.  I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.  I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!,5
1230,"I tried this for the first time and I loved it.  Nice bold taste, smooth.  The price was excellent considering what I have been paying elsewhere.  I intend to purchase this again if it is still available and would recommend it to people who prefer strong bold taste.",5
1234,When summer comes I am constantly drinking ice tea.  Last summer I was told to stay away from caffeinated beverages.  What was I going to do without my ice tea?  I looked in Amazon.com and WOW!  Amazon had Lipton Tea Bags and they were DECAFFEINATED!  I was saved!!!!  I ordered some and I have been enjoying my ice tea ever since.,5
1253,"I add this to the sugarfree cappuccino just to give it a flavor.  It tastes great, and does taste like York Peppermint Pattie Flavor.",5
1254,"If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product.",5
1263,"This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The ""meal"" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places.",5
1264,What else is there to say? A great strong flavored coffee at a great price.,5
1268,"I used to live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and learned from my relatives to brew and enjoy Community Coffee, preparing it in my little white porcelain beggin just like my grandmother and aunts.  I make my own blend of coffee beans and was so pleased to see that Amazon was now selling Community Coffee.  It is as good as I remember if being, particularly since I like a very strong, rich flavor.  I'm now using their Sumatran, French Roast, Expresso and Columbian to make my blends and am very happy with the results.  So are my relatives and friends who ask to use my blends themselves.  Great coffee from the land of strong coffee lovers.  I'm moving on to chicory laced coffee now as Community carries it.  Personally, I like this brand much better than other Louisiana coffees.",5
1270,"I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is my favorite.  The K cups perform well unlike another brand whose name I won't mention (WP) and the flavor is much bolder than every other brand.  Green Mountain used to have a bold one but it was discontinued except in sample packs (with other flavors).  This coffee has a nice taste, too.  I just wish I could find it locally and for less money.  You used to be able to get a bundle of large boxes from Amazon but they're not currently available.  I think this was the best price I could get but was disappointed when I received my 3 tiny boxes - if you overlooked it these boxes only contain 12 K cups each.  I'll keep looking for better value but in the meantime I can still enjoy a good cup of coffee made at home.  I gave it only four stars because of the price but I do recommend this coffee.",5
1275,"This tea tastes wonderful by itself with a little honey or stevia, if you are counting calories or carbs.  For a real treat, mix it with a little peppermint tea.  Bigelow makes a Morroccan Mint that is really great for this particular mix, but it is not available on Amazon (yet).",5
1279,"Unfortunately, I believed that by looking at the packaging, I was getting the OLD style gum, which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days, than the new cheap gum.  I loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after I've carried it in my pocket for a few days.  The old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions.  Needless to say, I am quite dissapointed in Wrigley's decision to CUT the quality of their Doublemint Gum.  And also, needless to say, this will be my last purchase of ANY Wrigley's products.  They had a good gum before.  ""If it ain't BROKE, don't fix it.""",5
1281,not the best coffee but it is not bad as well. we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we've got it is fine. Godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too.,5
1287,"Great Keurig tea pods.  This is not chai latte, so don't expect white milky beverages.  This is just tea flavored with chai spices.  I suppose if you add hot milk you could make a decent chai latte though, but I haven't tried it yet.  Very bright flavors, but not overpowering.",5
1288,"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate.",5
1301,"Bigelows only red tea (so far) is pear. The flavor is excellent, no caffeine, and its organic. The pear flavor is light and doesnt taste artificial (because its not). I have about 20 red teas that I drink regularly because it so low in tannins and doesnt aggravate my illness. Bigelows Asian Pear is one of my favorites.",5
1303,This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.,5
1309,"This is my favourite tea! At work, I sometimes cannot get to it right away and it doesn't matter how long it sits, it doesn't get that bitter bitter ""like your drinking a dandelion"" taste. It's refreshing and I can't start my day without it!",5
1310,"The leaf in the bag and the overall packaging quality is good but no one in our family and group of friends likes the taste.  Since it has all the other positive reviews, I've been subjecting people to it off and on since my July purchase trying to find at least one person to say it tastes good - with no luck.  It doesn't taste like peaches to us; it has an off taste that makes our gang say yuck.  We like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea (usually decaf and usually made as sun tea). Some of us add sweetener; some of us don't. We like peaches both fresh and canned. For these reasons, I can't blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea.  Maybe the passion fruit in it someone else mentioned ""isn't our cup of tea""?",5
1318,i love tazo teas i dont really like friuty ones but this one is okay it is tart so i have to over sweeten it its not one ove my favs,5
1323,"The products lid stays attached to the needle on the Keurig, allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. Very messy. If this didn't happen, it would work well.",5
1324,I love flavored coffee and Folgers is great.  Amazon has better prices then you can get at the store.,5
1326,We have been buying this coffee every month for six month.  It has a nice mellow earthy flavor with low acidity.  Considering I worked at starbucks for a few years I would say this is on par to their dark latin american blend.  The beans are always fresh.,5
1350,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a bag and try it. I had had numerous styles of Kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor. When it arrived I ground some up and brewed up a pot. The smell was there but the flavor was lacking. It was missing that Kona pop that I have experienced in the past with other coffee's. Over the next few weeks I tried different brewing combinations. No matter what I tried, it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor. I was quite disappointed by the coffee.",5
1364,I really like black tea and this is a great taste substitute while pregnant.  I had to brew it stronger than recommended but it's great.,5
1370,"My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes.",5
1372,This syrup is an amazing addition to any kitchen. It's delicious and smooth and goes very well with chai tea.,5
1373,This is absolutely delicious! My husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived. Just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry.,5
1377,My family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer.  We are not able to find affordable/quality loose tea in our community.  Lipton's loose tea is the best!,5
1390,"Make it hot, then enjoy it as hot tea or add ice cubes for iced tea. The varied flavors give you an opportunity to try out different flavors. Celestial knows how to make good tea!",5
1391,"Okay, so it doesn't taste exactly like pumpkin.  It does sort of have a pumpkin essence, however.  Maybe it just sort of smells pumpkin-y.  Either way, the tea is delicious.  My co-workers tease me about how many cups a day of it that I drink.  Personally, I like it with a packet of  Truvia,Natura's Calorie-Free Sweetener  1  Ounce Packages (Pack of 400)  or  NuNaturals Nustevia Nocarbs Blend, 50 Packets .  As far as the comment another reviewer made about the black tea tasting like Lipton's, maybe that makes it more authentic.  It is said that chai tea was first created in India to make undrinkable tea bearable.",5
1403,I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.,5
1407,"I'm a pretty big coffee drinker, but had never tried Kona coffee before. I gotta say, Hawaii Roasters Kona Coffee was the best coffee I ever had. The type of coffee you want to savor for the flavor rather than gulp down for the caffeine (which is really hard to do because it tastes so good, after your first sip you just want to keep downing it rather than savor it). I purchased my first package right before the holidays and it was a total hit with my family and friends. I am now totally hooked and strongly recommend Hawaii Roasters Kona to all coffee lovers.",5
1419,"Expensive but so far is the best green tea I could find. Coconut green is my favorite flavor, amazing. I will definitely order more.",5
1423,I thought this a nice evenly tasting coffee with no bitterness or after taste. I enjoy it and will buy more in the future.,5
1433,The coffee is great tasting but is expensive in my book. If Nestle hadn't sent me the machine for free I wouldn't have bought it. It leaks and is not a great machine for an office. Our office doesn't like it because you have to keep going to the bathroom to refill it with water because it only holds two cups worth of water. It does make a hot cup of coffee in a very quick time though.,5
1436,I personally use it to make iced tea. It tastes great with a little sweetner. Tha acai is not overpowering as in other teas I've tried.,5
1440,"I have a Keurig coffee maker. You know, the one with the K-Cups.  To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced.",5
1443,"I usually use Twinings English breakfast loose tea.  This was a poor substitute for that.  This tea has a strong, earthy taste, almost like dirt rather than tea.",5
1446,My favorite coffee!  It is very dark and has a wonderful flavor without the bitterness!  Reminds me of the coffees served in Germany.,5
1451,Maxwell House ground coffee from the supermarket is beter coffee. Searched underorganic coffee and got Lavazza. Amazon should give me about $13.00 back as a credit!..... Dave,5
1458,"I recently got a Keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of Decaf to come up with a favorite. Newman's Own is definitely not among them. Taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee, watered down with hardly any coffee taste. I happen to like robust coffee taste, and this one doesn't even qualify as ""medium"". If you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees, I would highly recommend the Green Mountain Robust Magic and for a little lighter touch the Donut House Decaf or Tully's. Also, of all the different brands I tried, the Newman's Own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction. NOT recommended!",5
1461,This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.,5
1466,"I have always enjoyed Timothys coffee, however the quality of this box was unacceptable. Out of 50 K cups 16 failed while brewing, coming loose at the edge and making a huge mess on my counter top. I will not be purchasing this brand of coffee again.",5
1471,"This is my favorite coffee ordered online, and I have ordered quite a few.  Bold but not bitter, and good for a crowd.  This is also a very nice price for good coffee, from what I have found.",5
1472,I had wanted to try this tea and the combination of teapot and tea was irrestible. The tea is very good and the teapot is great when it is just myself sitting down and relaxing. I have used the large bamboo container to set out guest tea selections in my home and the small container to carry tea with me camping. I would also recomend this as a gift to someone special.,5
1474,"I've never been much of a fan hazelnut, but I do enjoy drinking the International Hazelnut Non-Dairy creamier mixed into my morning cup of coffee.",5
1481,"The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me!",5
1489,"I found this product and price the best. I know this is an instant coffee, but it has great taste. You can't beat Amazon price or service any where.",5
1506,I got a Cuisinart single cup brewing system for Christmas and it came with 3 different K-Cups. Newmans Own is my favorite of the 3 by far. I would buy this coffee again! Nice and bold and rich!,5
1507,"I only got to drink one cup of this to make this review, but I thought it tasted great.  What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed.  I tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be.  I like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and I was sad I only got to have just one cup.  I had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well.  I couldn't tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid.  It tasted like regular coffee to me.",5
1517,"This is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable.  The grind is finer than what is normal for auto-drip makers, which is good because I can use less so it goes much further, making it even more economical.  I have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again.",5
1520,"Smells more like blueberry than it tastes. However, it make a great iced tea and sweetens nicely with agave syrup. I enjoy it.",5
1530,"this product is hard to find for us in stores in ohio, most k cups are french vanilla coffee, not cappuccino, its delicious, will buy again for sure!",5
1532,"Tasted this at a tea, came home and ordered the loose and the sachets.  I've shared some with a friend.  Harney makes wonderful tea.",5
1533,"If you are looking for a fantastic glass of iced tea WITHOUT the fuss, this product is for you! Just add water, your favorite sweetner, and enjoy!",5
1534,"It's not an amazing tea. It's an ""okay"" tea. I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result. I look for saving money. Will not repurchase.",5
1536,I give Foldgers a big yeah for this great tasting Columbian coffee. It's as good as dunking donuts and much better than Starbucks. It's just the right blend for breakfast. Love it Foldgers. I will continue to buy this coffee until I find something tastier.,5
1540,I like my coffee strong. This is the first brand that I have tasted that provides the kick I need without the bitterness. I keep my pantry stocked with Mahogony and I do not share!,5
1543,"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.",5
1545,"I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder.",5
1557,"This coffee tastes GREAT.  I usually purchase Folger's classic style blend from Sams $11 due to the convenience of the, packaging and expected level of flavor.  One day, I bought a 12oz. package of #4 from Seatle's Best from Wally World (Wal-Mart) for $6.00, having already experienced the goodness from Borders before they went bankrupt, I was happy to see a great price on the product.  I absolutely have fallen in love with this coffee!  A cup of this, and ""Coldstone Sweet cream"" Creamer is great.  Simply put, I prefer to have my day start with that combination and I'm saddened whilst I am at work and my cup finally runs empty.  However, the $31 price on 3 bags seems a bit high, as a 2-pack of 12oz goes for $15.00 on here as well.  Huge markup on the 3-pack, which makes no sense.",5
1558,"My husband and I love this coffee it has a nice smooth taste.  Sets our morning off to a good start even though it is D-caf  Delivery was fine, no problems at all.",5
1567,This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.,5
1570,"Strong aftertaste, and not a pleasant one.  Will try other powdered milk product. Did not order online, purchased from local grocery.",5
1586,"What can I say?  I just ordered another flavor from the same company.  Every one in my office comments on the rich smell and having a cup in the morning is something I look forward to.  If you like flavored coffee, you will like this one.",5
1589,This coffee tastes so good we have completely given up going out for coffee.  Love the ease of the product and Amazons fast shipping with Prime,5
1598,"I have been trying to find a good coffee that would not set off my ulcer and still tasted good. Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast is perfect for me. It tasted rich, full bodied and no harsh afterbite, AND it doesn't make my heartburn flare up. You will never miss anything this coffee has to offerr, except your heartburn!",5
1600,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).  Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.  There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.  1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.  2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.  Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.  If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.",5
1605,"The coffee has a bold without bitterness taste.  It is very delicious. I enjoy drinking Grove Square Coffee, Dark Roast every morning.",5
1608,"Preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person, so I'm not surprised some people like this brand and some do not. I drink coffee every day and have tried many different types. I've never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect.  In my opinion, this was very good.  It has a rich, dark roasted ""starbuck-like"" taste.  I recommend trying it.",5
1609,"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question.",5
1613,"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess.",5
1615,"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again.",5
1616,"My hairdresser has jumped on the Keurig bandwagon, which makes sense because different people have different tastes. This chai latte tasted exactly like a more pricey cup from a coffee shop. I was very impressed how quickly it was ready, the flavor, everything!!",5
1632,"My wife is a tea lover.  She finds Stash Premium White Christmas Tea soothing & delightful.  I thought the price was great, too.",5
1636,"Delicious loose earl grey tea.  I use it for making iced tea, my favorite.  Check out the Adagio IngenuiTEA brewer available here on Amazon for a great tea making setup.  My only wish is that Amazon stocked it in a bigger size.  I'm running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now.  Good for storing electronic cables, screws, poker chips, etc...  Loose tea is much better than bagged tea... more room for the leaves to brew.",5
1638,"OK, so some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my Keurig, but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea.  It had a very artificial flavor, much like instant tea, and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea.  I can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you.  Like the other reviewer, I can't bring myself to use what's left, and will probably end up throwing it out at some point.  My husband agreed, and he's a big iced tea drinker...and not all that picky about the taste.  He won't drink it, I won't drink it, and the cat won't drink it, so out it goes.  I do want to add that I use the hot teas and have liked them very much (especially the green tea).  There's just something about the iced flavors that don't work.",5
1650,"I've had many different types of Starbucks coffee and there are very few I don't like. I don't really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it. I usually prefer a dark bold brew like French but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint. It has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change. The smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews.  It's made with Latin American beans and has natural ingredients. Bring the empty bag to Starbucks when you're done and you'll get a free coffee.  Overall, the taste/quality i'll give 4 stars.",5
1654,"This is a product I have tried before and always have come back to.  Great aroma,flavor, and value!  Wikll buy again and again.",5
1668,If you like bold taste...then add it to your cart because you will love this coffee. This is one of my variety that I choose on a morning I need a jump start or a lecture from my Mom. Ha,5
1671,"I recently gave up coffee & made the switch to teas.  I've tried all the usual suspects.  Lipton & other grocery blends were bitter or weak.  I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  The Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose.",5
1676,"Nescafe Taster's Choice Instant Coffee is as good if not better than the local coffee shops. Plus, Nescafe Taster's Choise cost less than 10 cents per cup. Ron Jones from Texas",5
1681,"Great tasting coffee. Hard to find decaf hazelnut coffee, found this at Amazon, taste great, at a reasonable price. Tried more expenive decaf hazelnut coffee and was disappointed with the taste, didn't even taste like hazelnut, this is a full bodied hazelnut coffee",5
1697,"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others.",5
1702,"I love this stuff.  You can make it with milk or almond milk and put some whipped cream on top, it's amazing.  You can also blend it with ice to get a frap style drink.",5
1704,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.,5
1728,"I've only used one other Stevia product which was very good. This is just as good and does not leave any bitter aftertaste in my opinion. I only use it in my morning coffee- two packets for a 16oz cup. I'd definitely buy this product if I wanted to stick with something organic. However, I personally still prefer Splenda- whether it's good for me or not.",5
1732,Tastes great and so easy to make in the K cup machine!  Little more then I like to spend on Kcups but well worth it!,5
1748,"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash.",5
1758,"I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.",5
1760,I'm very happy with this tea.  The flavor is smooth and not bitter.  I've shared it with several people and gotten the same response.  Will buy it again!,5
1761,"Originally tried this because it was on sale, and I figured that even if it was gross I'd only be out a buck. Happily it tastes great, mainly have used it in coffee and tea. Just ordered my second box.",5
1767,"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier.",5
1777,Received product very quickly.  The k-cups taste fresh and robust compared to other Keurig cartridges. I will definitely be ordering for my office again!,5
1779,This espresso has a very smooth coffee taste.  I used it first in a press and then in my Mr. Coffee espresso machine.  The espresso definetly tasted better when pressed.  The price was excellent considering you get 4 cans.,5
1786,The Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha is delicious and easy to prepare.  My husband and I were both big fans of this drink.  A cross between hot chocolate and coffee.,5
1790,Bigelow Vanilla Caramel tea is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. I  use Silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste. I make my 5 cup pot of tea every morning using 3 bags of the Bigelow caramel tea with 2 bags of Bigelow decaffeinated English tea. I like my tea slightly decaffeinated. I wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing.,5
1799,"I purchased this lime juice a few years ago on a trip to Florida.  Goes great with everything, especially in a bloody mary.",5
1805,"I was expecting (or hoping) for a different variet of tazo, since I love the Awake and the Zen so much.  What I received was a brown paper bag with 5 Awake and 5 Zen and 1 small tea bag of peppermint.  The reason I gave it 1 star is that I love TAZO K-cups, but not for that price.  I could have 2.5 times the amount for that price.",5
1806,"In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(",5
1808,"I add this to my cold brew lipton ice tea that I prepare.  Took a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of juice concentrate but once perfected, it's like drinking the perfect blend of sweetened ice tea.  The taste is great and no calories, can't beat that.  Only demerits is that the price is rather high.  Could use a few dollars off on the bulk purchases.",5
1813,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.  Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).  Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.  I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.  I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.  Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.  As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.  No complaints here :)",5
1815,"The first ball worked pretty well, it just looked a little beaten up.  Since then, ~half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water (all of them do after sitting for a bit).  If you don't mind the rate of failure, the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time (especially considering that it is white tea).",5
1829,This k-cup actually smelled up the office. And it tastes as good as it smells. I found it to be very flavorful.,5
1831,"We lived in Hawaii for a few years.  Have been searching for Kona or Maui coffe.  We live in secluded area, so have been ordering on line.  Not too much acid.  Great tasting.",5
1845,"This Ginger Lemon Drink is a foil packet of instant powder that only needs a cup of boiling water to make a hot tasty very flavorful drink.  With the honey already included, it is excellent if you feel a scratchy throat or sniffle coming on.  I think you will like it as much as I did.",5
1867,These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I can't believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans!,5
1872,THIS COFFEE TASTES GREAT BEST VALUE FOR KERIG SYSTEM ONE THING YOU MUST DO WITH THIS COFFEE AFTER UNPACKING IS PUT IT IN A PLASTIC BAG TO KEEP FRESH YOU MUST KEEP THE AIR OUT DONT PUT IT IN THE FRIGE KEEP IT ROOM TEMP IF YOU ARE A COFFEE EXPERT LIKE ME YOU WILL LOVE THIS COFFEE RICH FLAVOR ALL FLAVORS ARE GREAT EVEN THE DECAF YOU WILL SAVE AROUND 10 CENTS TO 12 CENTS PER POD LEAVE IT TO AMAZON TO BRING US THIS GREAT COFFEE I AM A PRIME MEMBER I SAVE ON SHIPPING AND HANDILING BECOME A PRIME MEMBER AND SAVE WAY TO GO AMAZON,5
1878,I bought this tea for a diet I was going to start and find it very good. I drink it everyday now.,5
1885,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!",5
1898,"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.",5
1902,"lots of uses for this green tea...  I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...  Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another... from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...  To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.  I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago.... in the ground form known as matcha. A quality product. Dissolves well.  I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.",5
1910,"I have always loved ceylon black tea but this was the first time I tried green.  Again this is my very favorite.  It is very mild and does not have the ""grassy"" taste of other green teas.  I highly recommend it.  Ceylon and Amazon do it again!",5
1914,This Vanilla Biscotti flavor is one of my favorite coffees. Great flavor. Is truly the epitome of curling up with a good book by the fire kind of coffee. Folgers does a great job on their Gourment coffees.,5
1925,"I started Taster's Choice from Original Gourmet. After I bought French Roast, I found it labeled ""darker"" than the one I was drinking. I am afraid that it will be too strong. After I tasted it, I am so glad that it is the right taste for me. It is so convenient. I love it and highly recoment it!",5
1927,I like the packaging (individually wrapped) and the taste of the coffee.  Can't find a thing wrong with it.,5
1933,We drink a lot of iced tea in the summer and this is a nice change to put in the rotation so there is a little variety.,5
1934,"This is the best instant coffee I've ever tried. The aroma is rich and pure with a little caramelized flavor, no sour muddy tastes. I don't think it's pricey compare to other products and the quality I get. Absolutely worth every penny. The best drink to wake you up every morning! Don't hesitate, just try it!",5
1935,"This product makes a great cup of cofee, bold but not bitter, no bad after taste. The smell starts the experience  and the satisfied full flavor follows. I will buy this product as long as it is available !!",5
1937,"Bad tasting coffee, no aroma/baked, very dry, bitter, hard, harsh and unpleasant aftertaste of burnt charcoal. Not suitable for espresso and not creamy at all.",5
1940,"Some of the best coffee I've ever had. Smooth AND full of flavor. It does get a little bitter if you weaken it too much, but any coffee will.",5
1942,"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now.",5
1949,"This coffee tastes great. I have tried Lavazza and other non organic brands, but the taste of this coffee is very good and the price is reasonable. I will purchase it again.",5
1952,Strong smooth velvety flavor.  Mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking. Absolutely the best. I've found my favorite.,5
1960,This coffee has a rich flavor without any bitterness.  I usually do not like coffee made with dark beans because they are too strong for my taste but this coffee is great tasting.  I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save service and ordered just one 32 oz bag to try it.  The 15% discount and free shipping with the subscribe service makes it a great bargain too!,5
1978,This is a knockout bold coffee. It is great cup at the 12oz setting with tons of flavor. Haven't tried it yet at the 16oz setting but assume it will still pack a flavor punch. Great deal in the 50 pack.,5
1983,With it's own typical strong taste.. Like Taster's Choice also but this one surely tastes better.. With little quantity you can make it taste from mild to strong..,5
1984,"After suffering from flu like symptoms for a week, I tried this tea with honey and it was not only delicious, but after using for a day... I feel so much better.",5
1986,"Price is good along with the taste.  I like the dark, rich flavor.  Sealed well when shipped and received it quickly.",5
2005,"The coffee is excellent, easy to order and always arrives in a short period of time.  Love the convienence and am about to enjoy a fresh cup this morning.  We used to have coffee made in a drip coffee pot but by the time we would have a second cup the coffee lost much of it's taste and at times tasted burnt.  Never happens with Keurig coffee.",5
2010,"I'm pretty new to the coffee scene, but I really like this roast. It is quite flavorful and rich. It was the first coffee I bought, I tried a few more and I came back to this.",5
2017,"I received this produce pretty fast, the packaging is really cute but the tea is tasteless. It is a mint tea but I cannot taste the mint at all. Disappointed, will not order again.",5
2018,This is a great Chai Tea.  It's very aromatic and flavorful but not overpowering strong like some can be.,5
2032,"Great price for a lot of creamer. Just a bit at a loss of what to do with a giant box of creamers! Was hoping they'd come packed a little differently, but it's not a big deal.",5
2034,"The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.  I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.",5
2042,"Excellent tasting green tea for those who want to quit black tea or coffee.  I quit coffee cold turkey by substituting this tea.  I was up to 64 ounces of coffee a day. Now I drink 24 ounces of this tea daily. (three cups)  Yes, I feel a lot better! I have no desire for coffee anymore, but I do dabble with black tea. No longer do I have to trust others to serve me fresh coffee. Tea is always fresh, and you can carry a few envelopes of your favorite variety. Just add hot water.",5
2048,The taste of these teas are great. but i added honey to make it a little more sweet.,5
2058,I have run into Nonni's at the homes of various friends and never thought to try and get some for myself.  They are the perfect complement to my morning cup of coffee and give me a little pick-me-up without loading me up first thing in the morning.  Delicious!  Buy some!,5
2068,"First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.  I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.  I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.  I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.",5
2071,"Twinings seem to have discontinued their apple-cinnamon flavor.  This tea is very similar; it's more apple than cinnamon flavored, but neither flavor is overwhelming.  It has a nice fruity tang to it without being acidic.",5
2072,This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed.,5
2074,"Was looking for a brand other than sense and came across Baronet, could not be more pleased.  Great flavor, rich and tasty each and every time.  Will reorder again that is for sure.",5
2079,"Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again.",5
2088,I love this coffee it's my favorite so far I want to try them all. I don't like strong coffee and I hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup  of coffee. I'm not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion.,5
2107,"A LITTLE EXPENSIVE CONSIDERING ITS MAXWELL HOUSE.  BUT ITS BETTER THAN STARBUCKS, FRESH AND I WILL BUY AGAIN. FOR 1 CUP/PERSON ITS IDEAL.",5
2114,We like our coffee fresh and strong and this product fills the bill. Delivered fresh and full flavored.,5
2116,"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.",5
2125,"Tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker. Don't get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries. I bought 6 boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining. It's organic, good tasting, and has health benefits without the caffeine. Can't go wrong!",5
2136,"This is my favorite tea, but I was having trouble finding it in stores. When I looked here they had 40% off and free shipping so I stocked up.",5
2138,I was expecting a plain old cup of coffee when I popped this into the Keurig; Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a party in my mouth.  This coffee was delicious.  I will definitely buy this again.,5
2142,"For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.  Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.  Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.)",5
2146,"Great tea.  Wonderful, mellow flavor.  You won't regret buying this tea.  Fantastic buy!",5
2157,best big train flavor out there! and price is way cheaper than finding these packets locally at a coffee shop.,5
2159,Newman's Own Special Blend Extra Bold is a great tasting coffee for any time of day.  It's flavor stands out even with cream.  I like strong bold coffee and this is my favorite every day general use coffee.,5
2161,"My girlfriend uses this product in her coffee to ""disguise"" the coffee taste.  Instead of using sugar, she adds half a package and some milk.  She loves it!  It tastes great on its own too.",5
2164,"As we sample many flavors of k-cups from Amazon.com, a few stand out and Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend stood out. It has a fantastic flavor. Rich and delicious. I recommended it to one of my co-workers and they enjoyed it as well. This will be one of my stock items from now on.",5
2167,"I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.  When I first opened the box at work, my co-workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum ""Big Red"".  When I got to the first sip I encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before I was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon.  It felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other.  Face-scrunching ensued.  I will not be finishing this box.",5
2188,"If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not ""stew"" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area.",5
2191,This most definitely is a green tea of superior quality. It is economical in that its yield is a bit stronger than average - one needn't double up bags to get a decent flavour.,5
2198,"Tried a new coffee recently and have to say that Emerils Gourmet Coffee was just what I expected, a dark bold flavor that I love.",5
2201,"Espresso pods are a no-fuss, no-muss way to go. I use the MyPressi espresso maker, which I love, and pods make clean-up a snap. The Lucaffe mixed case includes two SKUs. I kind of wish there's been more, but both are so tasty I can't complain. They also arrived loose in a box, which was surprising for me, but not a particular problem. Five stars because both my ""complaints"" are trivial and are irrelevant to the quality of the product.",5
2203,"I purchased the Cafe Mocha when Amazon was having a sale on the pack of 3, otherwise, the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it.  The mocha was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste, so I mixed it with a small (espresso shot) k-cup of regular coffee, which made it taste like a mocha from Starbucks. You can also get the same taste if you use a k-cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k-cup of regular or decaf coffee... and it will still be less costly than the Cafe Escapes at regular price.  All in all, I'm happy with the product and would continue to buy, if only the price was better.",5
2215,"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one.",5
2224,"I don't know if this product tastes exactly like the thai tea in the restaurants, nor do I know if I'm brewing the tea exactly the way they do. But, it tastes very good, and I look forward to drinking it. It's a personal treat. It is best served with regular half and half. Not milk or fat free half and half. I brew it using my coffee maker. I put the filter paper, just as if I were about to brew some coffee. I use my judgement with the amount of tea to water ratio. And i can now visualize the amount I need for a specific strength. All in all, it's a good product. Only had a problem with the shipping. I live in NYC. And will perhaps search for this product in China town next time. But until then, I have two bags to keep me busy.",5
2226,i love ordering on line esp from amazon>> just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped this coffee is fantastic try it also donut shop is great,5
2232,I just got my coffee the other day. It taste as good as it sounds. I love it. Would recommend all to try it.,5
2233,"Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just can't get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so I'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it's bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*that's been pissed on in the woods).",5
2238,"I bought this tea to try something new (I was tired of ordinary bergamote teas), and now I've ordered it again. Great taste, nice can.",5
2239,"I got the sampler pack, and was, in general, very happy with the coffees. I generally prefer my coffee on the intense side (no, not burnt, but with a lot of flavor), so I found the Corner Donut Shop to be too mild for my taste, but Cyclone was much more in line with my preferences.  The coffee was all really fresh for a K-Cup. I found the ones marked Extra Bold to have the right amount of taste, while the regulars were passable.  Now that I've sampled the variety, I'm ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate.",5
2246,"I love all the Dolce Gusto milky coffees, but this is my favorite.  Pricewise and tastewise, this beats the expensive coffee shops any day.",5
2247,"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented",5
2256,"I was introduced to Kilambe coffee by a friend and immediately i tasted quality. It is now part of my special collection along with my Vietnamese coffee used only on weekends, special occasions, or having guests over. If you enjoy a dark, bold taste with the slightest scent chocolate and a fruity feel from mother nature at high altitude, Kilambe is for you.",5
2274,This is about as good a cup of coffee as you can get.  Single serving is great and although it may cost more per pound it saves money in the long run because you don't throw any away.  Always hot and always fresh.  With scheduled deliveries I never run out.  I strongly recommend it.,5
2279,"great taste, good price... Always looking for some flavor to add to my tea muixture, this works better than most of the ones I've tried",5
2283,This is a great tasting cup of coffee even though a little strong  for some.  My only complaint is the price. I drink several cups of coffee a day and this is cost prohibitive for me.,5
2287,"Just tried my first cup and it's as good as the restaurant stuff I typically pay a premium for ($3 for 8-12oz with ice). I'm loving it!  Update: I tried the Pantainorasingh brand, which is not nearly as good as this brand. Sadly, I may end up throwing away the other brand even though I hate to be wasteful. The taste is very different.",5
2288,This is the most expensive water I've seen. Who are they marketing to...lottery winners only? Nobody should pay this much.,5
2303,"Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.  Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste.",5
2308,"This tea tastes even better with some milk and honey. By itself, it's better than average.",5
2322,"This is a very nice, full bodied coffee with a very delicious taste.  It's a nice favored coffee to wake up to in the morning.  I would reccommend this coffee to a person who likes a medium strength and blend coffee.",5
2325,"The first thing I would like to say is that the bottom of the k cup is a mesh not plastic but it still goes in my keurig machine just like a regular plastic bottom k cup. I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  It does look a little different from what you may be used to seeing, but works just the same. Now as to the taste of the coffee, I think that it is a full body flavor. If I want a strong taste I brew regular size amd if I wish to have a milder flavor I will brew the largest cup size, I have the best of both worlds. I immediately went on subscribe and save.  I order 5 boxes at a time.  Love the flavor of this coffee.  Now to my complaint. I notice today that the price of each box has increased approximately $2.54 a box and that is within about three weeks time. Now I really love the convenience of my Keurig, however eventually the price of the k cups will reach a price that will cause me to say NO MORE. That time is approaching quickly. This brand started out to be more reasonable than most, but with this price jump in the last three weeks I am afraid they (the company) will soon be way overpriced as are the other brands.  Again I will say I do love the flavor of this coffee. Did I mention my husband likes it as well and he normally does not like decaf coffee.",5
2338,I love these K cups they have a nice tea taste. They are cheaper than other places. I love them cold too.,5
2344,This French Roast is by far my favorite. I like a strong tasting coffee. I also like the new packaging but I am glad that I didn't buy a Keurig K-Cup holder. The way this coffee is packaged you will have to put it in a covered container. This type of K-Cup recycles better too.,5
2345,This gum is wonderful.  A little expensive and cost prohibative for people that chew alot of gum. No after taste.  I hope they bring the price down and come up with more flavors.,5
2353,"The price is great and the teas are individually wrapped which is a plus since the exterior box of mine was torn and tapped in places.  Haven't tired them yet, but the box says not to use them in more than 3 cups of water.",5
2365,"I'm not a ""tea snob"" and this tea taste GREAT!. Came fresh and packaged well and at a MUCH better price then the local tea shop and health food stores!",5
2369,"This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.  The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract",5
2374,I usually drink green tea and have used this tea during the summer for iced tea and love the taste.  Very refreshing and prefer this over the store bran green tea.,5
2379,"I was surprised at how good this tasted.  It's sweet and you can really taste the pineapple.  It also has only 10 calories per 16oz serving (better than soda) and it mixes well in water.  The tea also doesn't have that strong instant tea after taste.  I would definately, buy this again.",5
2383,"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better.",5
2384,"My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will bring this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!",5
2402,"A friend introduced me this Good Earth Tea, which I found very flavorful the first time I tried it. I was glad to find that I could buy the tea on Amazon, and have now given it as a present to another tea lover.",5
2406,"I was originally using the ""Morning Blend"", which had a good taste, but I think this blend is smoother.  Also, the price is a little less, so it's a win/win situation.",5
2409,"I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.",5
2417,i first tasted this coffe at a casino and was delighted with the wonderful taste. it has good flavor and is very affordable  i highly recommend it,5
2423,"With both a stomach problem and a love of coffee, I thought this would be a great solution. I was wrong. I just didn't care for the taste. I recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a 10-pack of bags for home brew. :(",5
2425,"This k-cup is one of my favorites along with Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Black Tiger.  If you like a strong, rich coffee, this will fit the bill.",5
2427,"What is better than caffeine and sugar? This product blends great coffee, sugar, and cream to produce a little cup of paradise.",5
2429,"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.",5
2433,"My husband uses all of these favors in his coffee drinks; it is hard to pick a favorite because they all taste so rich and flavorful. They are in plastic bottles, wrapped up nice and sent quickly. My husband scoffed when I originally bought this pack, but once it arrived (the next day, love amazon!) He thought I was a genius! With two vanillas (regular and French) hazelnut, peppermint, caramel, and raspberry it's a great selection for a great price. Highly recommended.",5
2435,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.  The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it.",5
2441,"I love this pumpkin coffee, it tastes and smells great.  Not too much flavor, and it doesn't taste too artificially flavored",5
2444,"If you like black tea, this is excellent.  I bought it because I tried it at Bigby coffee and loved it.  It is worth the price.",5
2450,"Not to sweet, not too bitter. The blueberry is not overbearing, but yet you know it's there.  Overall, I like it.",5
2452,"Gloia Jeans Butter Toffee coffee has a great taste. The smell of the aroma as the coffee brews starts an enjoyable experience. Sit back, relax and enjoy a cup!",5
2467,"I've been drinking peppermint tea for about 25 year. In fact my family used to grow and harvest peppermint tea from our own patch. To me, this tea tastes great, and has a good minty kick to it. I'd certainly purchase this again. I use a little mesh tea ball infuser and pack it full regardless of the size cup I use. At this moment I am drinking a 20oz cup and the strength is good. I declare this a phenomenal value!",5
2470,Works great in my iced tea brewing machine that I use in my concession trailer. Tastes great! Customers cannot believe that we use Lipton tea & not some cheap off brand like almost every concession stand uses. We only serve our customers the best!!,5
2472,"I drink lots of tea, and I must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety. The flavor is deep and hearty, and creates a nice dark brew. My parents thought that it was a bit 'too strong', but I think that it is right-on (although one teabag can be used to make several perfectly good cups of tea). If you're looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend that you give this a shot.  It didn't totally blow me away, so I can't give it 5 stars - some loose tea (not in bags) that I have tried has been more flavorful, so that's why this gets a solid 4.",5
2474,Purchased my first Keurig brewer after using a regular machine. Quick and easy in the morning and the Emeril coffee tastes great.,5
2477,"This tastes like a tropical cocktail... all it needs is the alcohol (didn't try adding that).  The mango flavor is pungent and if you like that flavor, you will like this tea.  Very enjoyable taste.",5
2479,"I love ginger, especially the crystalized ginger candy and this beverage tasted just like those candies to me.  I tried it hot and cold.  I love it both ways, but maybe the cold a bit more. How nice it would be to take some of these packets on any type of trip that would get me sick from motion sickness.  It tastes so good, that I'd drink it just because, but to know it's good for my digestion makes it all the better.  If you like the taste of ginger, you'll love this drink.  Tastes so natural and good.",5
2495,"This is fine. It's just not all that.  Perhaps if I had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup, I would have given it more stars. (I used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice). And perhaps if I didn't get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it...I might have gone for three stars. (Unsure whether this caused the headache--I have to try it one more time). But, the end result tasted like tea...nothing special and at 11.70 per bag--uh, I'd rather go for Celestial Seasonings if I want some caffeine-free tea-beverage-drink.  SO if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea, this might be for you--otherwise go for some loose-leaf and steep the hell out of it.",5
2498,"I love this coffee. I've been drinking Eight O'Clock for years until I tried Cameron's Southern Pecan, which is much better. It has a definite nutty flavor, the pecan flavor itself more subtle, but definitely detectable. A little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right. I find that 2 level tablespoons to 6 oz. of water is about right, but I make mine slightly stronger. Anything less than 2 tablespoons to 6 oz. and it'll taste like average store-bought. It's just got a wonderful warm flavor. I just make enough for 2 cups in the morning, grinding enough beans for 3 days so it doesn't lose flavor. Great stuff!",5
2503,"I have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee I drink (5 cups a day, maybe.) So I am mixing 1/3 Melitta Colombian and 2/3 decaf. I substituted this for the other decaf I have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste. Very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has. The price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well. I don't care for the packaging, however. I couldn't get it open without cutting the top, and then I had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it, with all the mess that that entails. If it were in a can, I would be more inclined to buy it. But the taste for a decaf is quite good.",5
2512,"After reading about Yerba Mate in Eat This, Not That I had to try it.  It is a great tasting tea for any tea lover to add to their flavor selection.",5
2531,"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.",5
2545,I shared this with my daughter and her family.  We enjoy the smooth mellow taste. Good hot or cold.  We enjoy high quality speciality loose teas and this is equal to Tevanas.,5
2554,"It's tasty although they say ""a medley of oranges mingled with piquant leaves."" I also enjoy it because it's caffeine free, good for chilly nights.",5
2559,I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.,5
2561,This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.,5
2562,"I use to grab my coffees at local stores, now do all my coffee shopping here, because of price and quanity, my wife loves the flavor of this coffee and swears by it. I bought the Kurig and have to say for time saving, and convience it's the best out there. It's also the only one that allows you to brew your on blends. Also try Paul Newmans organic blend, that's my brew.",5
2565,I love this coffee!  It has very good flavor for decaf.  I have been looking for a good decaf coffee because i've been trying to give up caffeine - and this is the best one I have found so far.,5
2569,"I am usually not the biggest fan of green teas, but this is really, really good. It has a third of the caffeine as an 8 ounce coffee with lemongrass, spearmint, passion fruit, and plum flavors. I was an instant fan, and the fact that it is healthy for your immune and digestive system are added bonuses.",5
2570,"This is really good price for loose leaf earl grey tea! It smells wonderful and tastes great too. The quality is definitely comparable with Teavana and other more expensive loose leaf tea, but only costs 1/4 as much.",5
2591,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.  Excellent taste and wonderful to take with you. I get just order some hot water at any restaurant and bring my own pack.,5
2594,I bought this on a Fri. sale. At 50 cents a kcup it was a nice deal and it's definitely one of the better green mountain flavors.,5
2599,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters.",5
2600,"My three-year-old loves these. They always come quickly, they're crunchy, sweet (but not overly sweet), and delicious. I will be ordering these many more times.",5
2610,"Marley Coffee One love Organic is dark, rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone. Not bitter, but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it, that does speak of Jamaica and Blue Mountain although the label does not claim it is Blue Mountain coffee. These packets are about one normal scoopful, and can be used in single serving coffee makers but I put one in my 2-4 cup espresso machine and it was fantastic.",5
2612,"Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste. I am not sure what a person can say about tea, but this flavor is one of the best I have ever had. It makes great hot tea or iced tea. It's pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener.  Some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not. Every cup is very special. Even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time, it never gets bitter. Wonderful product! Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",5
2617,"As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.  I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.  I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)  Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.",5
2618,"This was a gift to our son-in-law and from what I understand, he really enjoyed it -- rich, full-bodied flavor.",5
2621,"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!",5
2622,"I was very disappointed.  I love good cider, having grown up and gone to the mill each year.  I like most grocery store cider as well.  This stuff was really bad, tasted to me like raw chemicals.  Went through 4 or 5 people who spit it out directly.  Not my machine, they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it.",5
2628,This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags.,5
2629,A bit pricey but has a Great taste. Love it in my tea and I use it in my deep conditioners for my hair.,5
2638,"I ordered two boxes and the K-Cups are less than half filled with coffee, Sounds more like little maracas. Also leaves grounds at the bottom of cup. Apparently there is not a return policy for these K-Cups. Very bummed out.",5
2640,"If you want 100% Kopi Luwak, this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner. It's not as good as some of the stuff I've had, but it's definitely in that special class that Kopi Luwak belongs in. I've served this for guest, given it as gifts, and enjoyed it on special occasions. I've made it in French press, drip, and in one special instance Espresso!  To truly enjoy it, use about 8 grams of beans per 7 ounces of hot water used to brew. This is the appropriate ratios. Serve black, no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat. This bean isn't for everyone, but don't worry! It's not an acquired taste, its just a different taste :-)  Product arrived fast thank to prime, fresh as I wanted, and the beans tasted just like they do when I buy them locally from Rao's Bakery here in TX (same beans same company).",5
2642,"Excellent fine ground coffee that easily bests more well-known brands, it is aromatic and tasty without bitterness. For the price (currently about $5 for 12oz can on an Amazon subscription) you can't beat it.",5
2644,"This coffee has a rich flavor and nice body without any bitterness, no matter what kind of machine you use. I enjoy it at all  ties of day but especially in the afternoon or after a good meal. Exceptional depth. I love my Illy coffee.",5
2659,"Great combination of coffee, chocolate and raspberry flavors.  Stays fresh in the bag for a long time.  A bit more astringent than I usually like, but still very good.",5
2666,"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness.",5
2668,"As a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor, I find this tea amazing.  I was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that.  I can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but I will continue to drink it probably every day.  Enjoy",5
2669,This is really good coffee and the price is right.  My husband enjoyed this coffee as well.,5
2672,"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me.",5
2682,"I had problems with the order, but I am writing this review just about the coffee.  We buy this coffee so that every Friday at work, I can make a special pot of flavor. My co-workers really seem to enjoy the fun flavors of this brand, especially the chocolate ones. We will continue to purchase this brand in the future!",5
2685,The taste is great(tropical punch).  You have to dilute from the measurements they gave you or its way to strong.  Only knock is that if its not drunk immediately it collects at the bottom,5
2690,Great price for a great product!  This is much more subtle than green tea and tastes great with a little cinnamon.,5
2700,"OK, the package says that these are ESE pods, they look the same as other ESE pods, have the same shape and size as other ESE pods that I have around, and weigh the same as other ESE pods, as far as I can tell. These pods even brew for about as long other ESE pods using my Saeco Espresso Classico machine. I don't know whether it's the grind that Lavazza uses, but the Lavazza pods don't seem to be as tightly packed as other ESE pods, and the resulting espresso is slightly less strong than the espresso made by the other ESE pods. That being said, the espresso is perfectly acceptable, particularly when you take into account the price that you pay when you go on Amazon's subscription plan.",5
2739,This brand is the best tasting ever.  No bitter flavor at all.  Filtering the tea after brewing assures a clear beverage.,5
2753,"Great tasting, rich flavor, perfect for making a nice hot cup of Mocha. I bought this to test it against Hershey's syrup for my Mocha and there is an incredible distinct taste difference that is noticeable. This is much richer and tastes more like chocolate, and less sugary then Hershey's syrup.",5
2770,This is some of the smoothest coffee I've ever tasted. For people who don't really like the taste of coffee I'd highly recommend this coffee. It doesn't have any bitter aftertaste. It really is incredibly smooth!,5
2797,"Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as  Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count  and  Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count ), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.  I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.  I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.",5
2799,"I love a very strong coffee, but dislike any trace of bitterness. This coffee has a very delicious, smooth flavor. I highly recommend for any true coffee lover.",5
2802,This is a very tasty tea. I served it at a bridal shower and it was one of the favorites. My husband loved it and took the remaining tea bags to work. We'll be ordering more!,5
2807,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories.",5
2816,"I received my package today, ""FOG CHASER"" and was the first cup really good. Full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh....and no, i don't know or work for the company, just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys 6-8 boxes of K-cup coffee a month. I noticed NO sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe Kuerig a percentage....which drives up the price of all coffe in K-cups. IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.  I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie. I don't need to show off my coffee in a carousel, so this is just great to get a ""subscription discount"" for this good of a coffee that will fit my k-cup brewer.",5
2818,"this is a good as it gets next to starbucks and since it is in your own home, it is even better!",5
2821,I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?,5

Sumatra is good also if you like dark rich coffee... Love the ease of the pod system but will probably go to the K-Cups! Just not available enough anymore.",5
2844,"I love Blueberry coffee... and this was very good... But if you purchase, do not get whole bean, get it ground before they send it. The oils in the flavoring make it tough on some grinders.",5
2845,Tastes great when you combine 1 pack of Twinings Green Tea and 1 pack of Lipton Black Tea in a hot cup of water and add 1 or more teaspoon of sugar. Make sure to remove the teabags from your cup within few minutes to avoid the strong bitter taste.,5
2847,"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.  Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!",5
2848,"This is a great price, and to have it have it delivered by weekly can't go wrong, and the coffee is good",5
2849,"In order for tea to be labeled ""decaff"" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf.",5
2853,"We've tried a lot of coffee cups and I find this one the best tasting.  I hit the ""biggest"" cup button and the coffee still has a lot of flavor for me.",5

2858,"In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.  All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.  I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights.",5
2860,"This illy issimo ""italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa"" is quite delicious. The cocoa taste is subtle and it is not too sweet. The smooth taste beats out other similar prepackaged drinks I've tried.  Each 200ml / 8.45 oz. can is only 100 calories, 1.5g fat and 4g of protein, so it feels like a decent choice nutritionally. It contains 81mg of caffeine, if you are counting.  illy roasts good coffee and even masked by the sugar and milk, you can tell this 100% Arabica coffee is the good stuff. It is very smooth, no bitter / burnt taste like some coffee roasters are prone to. These drinks are made in Denmark and distributed by Coca Cola in the US, which piqued my interest. I'd recommend these to people who like to have some cold coffee drinks on hand for busy mornings or a quick pick me up.",5
2875,"Dandy Blend has such a great taste [to me] that it is not necessary to buy any coffee when away from home, the packets work great.  I use a spoonful of sugar and a little non-dairy creamer that I also carry with me in my handbag.  I find I have the Dandy Blend mixture in the afternoon and it satisfies me.  I will continue to buy Dandy Blend.",5
2879,"I've had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products, so I was hoping for something better with the MiO Sweet Tea.  At first I got the mixture wrong-- I put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water.  There was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong.  Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  The flavor is great, and I love it!  The 24 servings of this product were gone in no time, as I made 16 ounce servings frequently.  I imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing, so be careful as you squirt it out, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending this.",5
2893,"Although it's low acid, it's still good tasting and it does not cause me Heartburn. I no longer have to take Prilosec daily. I would definitely order some more of this coffee. I receommend it to fellow Heartburn sufferrers.",5
2894,So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.,5
2895,"These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.  So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike.",5
2901,"My mom loved iced coffee.  Living in Sacramento, hot coffee just isn't appealing when its 110 outside.  But you want your coffee fix.  So, she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the 60s version of the coffee maker, the percolator coffee maker.  The coffee wasn't that good, but you could make a lot of it, and then refrigerate it, pour it over ice, and sweeten and cream it to taste.  Yumm!  Starbucks makes it easier.  You just purchase the Frappuccino Mocha, pop it into the refrigerator, let it cool down, pour it over ice, and you have delicious iced coffee, sweetened and creamed just how I like it.  What's not to like?  It is expensive.  But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.  It's really more of an indulgence than a necessity.  I like to have a couple of bottles in the 'fridge during the summer, for those times when I want something cold to drink, but don't want to have a soft drink.  Iced coffee sometimes is just what you want.  Moderately Highly Recommended.  Five stars for taste, five stars for the convenience, three stars for the price.  Over-all, a winner.",5
2917,I use this as one of my herbal teas on the HCG protocol.  It's smooth and tastes good.  NO noticable side effects.  Would recommend.  I'v drank almost half the box now and I actually brew it in my coffee maker in the mornings.  Wonderful. Will repurchase.  Shipping fast and item as described,5
2931,I love strong tasting tea and these has no taste. I feel like I'm just drinking hot water. I would not recommend it.,5
2945,"As a big fan of Arnold Palmers, half lemonade half iced tea over ice, I'm pleased with this K-Cup variety.  I add a bit of sugar after brewing it over a big cup filled with ice, and its a great alternative to soda or trying to mix an Arnold Palmer myself at home.",5
2953,"If you like vanilla, you will love this. I am not a big fan of vanilla, and this literally tastes like I am eating the melted vanilla ice cream out of a bowl. Much too sweet for me.",5
2954,I like good coffee and have tried quite a few different coffee beans.  I have been very satisfied with the flavor of Cameron's Organic French Roast whole bean coffee.  Plus it is organic which is just a wonderful extra.  I certainly intend to keep buying this coffee if the flavor continues to be so good!,5
2956,"I enjoyed this tea just plain, without honey or sugar.  It was tasty and refreshing.  It was good hot and cold.  Very mild and much tastier than just plain green tea.  I would definitely recommend this.",5
2958,This is excellent coffee - a bit strong - which I personally like.  Price is good enough for this quality.,5
2959,"This is a very tasty, powdered instant decaf chai tea mix. It blends easily and well and tastes delicious. i like to take a few packets when I travel",5
2968,This has become our first choice for coffee. We have a Bed and Breakfast and the guest always comment on how good the coffee is. Great taste with a fantastic price.,5
2977,I will buy a new coffee maker before I will pay that much for the cup holder! I think it is due to the availability of the product.,5
2979,"Realllllly good!, I saw this reviewed on Seattle Coffee Gear's site and being me I thought oo I wonder if its on amazon! sure enough.. They had the whole bean version which I wanted more but but no grinder yet so I bought drip and since I hadn't tried it before I was wondering if it was really good or if it was just meh. This is awesome coffee, the drip grind is really great too and strong! I learned quick that you do not want to use too much now if your big on strong coffee go nuts, I used a cone type filter and used 2 1/2 tablespoons and I didn't really level off much and it was sooo strong but not bitter it was super smooth and it was chocolaty really good, love this coffee plan on buying more :0) if you can't find it on here just go to their website.",5
2980,"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.  With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.",5
2991,"Organic green tea, with absolutely fantastic aroma is hard to find. This is a great example of a great tea. The leaves are very large when they open up, which is how the tea is supposed to be. Aroma is not overwhelming, great!!!! Will buy again and again!",5
2992,It works and the taste is very pleasing. I will order again to get through those occasional sleepy afternoons. Works faster than a cup of coffee.,5
2996,"We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it. Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count",5
3003,"I am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea. It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA. There is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry, large and not compacted at all in the bag. In fact, the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball. Does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols? Can not find substantiation from USDA. They talk a good talk but product is severely lacking.",5
3017,"This coffee is excellent. It's a lighter blend so those who prefer chewable coffee may not like it. It has an amazing scent of a chocolate donut. I'm new to the K Cup, but so far, this is one of my favorite flavors.",5

3064,"I love this tea, It has flavor, and zaz.  you should try it.",5
3065,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny.",5
3078,"I'm typically a tea drinker. After the first pot, I made coffee every day until it was gone. Would definitely recommend.",5
3079,"I started drinking the blueberry hibiscus tea because I read that hibiscus helps to reduce blood pressure. I have never been a hot tea drinker until about a month ago. It did take me a few cups to get used to the taste. Now, I really enjoy the taste. I even miss it when I skip my nightly cup. I find it also relaxes me before bed. It is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener. The blueberry is an added bonus! I am willing to pay the steep price because I am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out-of-control blood pressure. The price on Amazon is a bit higher than at Whole Foods where I shop.",5

3098,"This is a poor excuse for coffee - even for instant coffee. I was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web - unfortunately, I was disappointed. I tried this coffee using the specified instructions, and also tried using less water. The best I can say of it is that it is weak garbage. It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee.

I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection).",5
3221,"I contacted the seller regarding the best type the raw or liquid type for baking and they recommended the raw type.  I was disappointed with the results. Since then, I tried this in iced tea and again, was disappointed.  I had to continually stir the contents of a large pitcher because the honey sunk to the bottom.  The taste of the honey never diminished, but it was a pain in the neck to do the stirring every time I wanted a glass of iced tea.  Next time I will buy the regular honey.",5
3231,This is one of the few teas that I will always have on hand.  It is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste.  I drink it almost every day.,5
3240,The quality of these cups were awful.  Several of them broke open in my keurig brewer and leaked grounds into my coffee. This has not happened with any other brand of k cups.,5
3249,"This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was ""natural flavor""  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.",5
3251,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.",5
3252,"I like this coffee! For me, finding this on Amazon was a true buy as I had this while in New Orleans. For the price, for the taste, and it is a family owned operation, that's all I need. You will not be disappointed in the French Roast.",5
3260,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends. Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory. A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines. A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste. If you like European style ground coffees, you may also like to try  Douwe Egberts Intense - Real Coffee Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)  which is Dutch, or the bold flavored  Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4) .  Another point worth mentioning is cost, these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups, and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices. When compared to gourmet stores like Gevalia, they are a steal, and great quality.",5
3267,I drink this between brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission wrestling class to recharge.  Taste great.  Lime is my fav.,5
3271,"Hot from the toaster, add a scoop of ice cream - I like chocolate - drizzle with some hot fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream - ooooo! It's too good. Not just a toaster pastry anymore.",5
3291,I purchased this for some family members that only like instant coffee. They have really enjoyed this and I tried it and found out it has a great taste. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a great cup of coffee without having to make a full pot when they only want a cup.,5
3292,This coffee has a smoother and more mellow taste than less expensive brands such as Folgers and Maxwell House.  And this is a terrific price compared to grocery store prices.,5
3299,I have always wanted a Tea I could drink at night that would not wake me up at 3 in the morning.  I have always liked Black Currant. So this was a win win for me.  The tea is delicious.,5
3304,"I don't like plain coffee but even more, I don't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers. Even the sugar-free creamers have a ton of fat, part of which is hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated.  Flavor Blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers. Easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere. This is not a creamer but more a flavored ""sugar"". One packet gives a yummy, subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with Splenda are.",5
3305,"I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, they're 5-star!).  This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!  I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!  I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!",5
3312,"When we got our Keurig coffee-maker, I was excited to try new coffees.  Most are way too strong for me.  I do like flavor, but way too often the K-cups are more bold than I like.  This Caramel Drizzle has just the right combination of coffee and caramel and makes for a nice rich but smooth cup of coffee.",5
3313,Iam a shopper for QUALITY for less.  This coffee is a EXCELLANT value as it has a great coffee taste. I hope this company comes out with some flavored coffees for my afternoon treat.,5
3315,"I have been very happy with the Grove Square K-Cup products.  I really like the creamy Cappuccino French Vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla is great when you want a coffee that's creamy with a light flavor.  Great Price, cost less then other K-Cups which is also a great selling point!  I also like Grove Square Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider, and think the Grove Square Medium Roast is okay (it is an instant coffee, so it's lighter in flavor but still good).",5
3332,I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!,5
3334,"Coffee flavor is so personal.  I love the taste of this coffee. I gave one to a friend at work and he thought it was much to strong. He freely admits that he has no problem drinking the company supplied coffee that sits in the big metal coffee urn all day,  My other friend drinks this kona blend  black and he loves it. I'm not a huge coffee snob, I drink Maxwell House French Roast at home. I  look forward to having a good tasting cup of coffee at work and this really fits the bill. I put sweetener and cream in my coffee so it's important to get coffee that has flavor can stand up to the added ingredients..  Even with cream and sugar the flavor is bold and smooth.",5
3338,"I had my first taste of this coffee at the cafe Monde in New Orleans, of course with their hand made donuts(Beneigns). The coffee is very strong, when you brew it, use much less than you would normally use than regular coffee. The chicory adds a distinct flavor but also smoothes it out. Its famous for a good reason... but remember to use less when brewing. John from Buffalo",5
3348,"It is hard to find whole bean decaf coffee in the first place, but finding one that actually tastes great is even better.",5
3349,"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag. I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE""  that uses different and patented cups.",5
3355,"This is one of my favorite kinds of coffee for my Keurig. It has a nice dark taste that is not overpowering while still being strong. My mother hates strong coffee and when she comes to my house she will resuse one of these K-Cups after I've made mine to knock the punch out. Whatever your pleasure, I guess!",5
3361,"I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!",5
3369,I like anything by this  company and wish more flavors available from amazon.  the apple cinnamon is very versatile and makes especially good iced tea also.,5
3373,"I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt.",5
3378,"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.  Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.  That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!",5
3391,"The sole reason I purchased the Tassimo machine was because I love Starbucks coffee. I think it is disgraceful the prices that are being charged for the T-discs for Starbucks coffee since Starbucks discontinued their relationship with Tassimo. On average, it is close to $8 a t-disc. Something is very wrong with this picture.",5
3396,"This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many brands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again.",5
3398,The coffee is very flavorful.  I'd prefer a medium roast if it were available but this coffee is still very good.  The price is also exceptional.,5
3399,"Great value, great taste.  Nothing like a cup of Caribou without having to leave home!  Would purchase this item again.",5
3406,"I love this tea!  Both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh.  I have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites.  I didn't realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until I had this brand.  For organic tea, it is quite reasonably priced.  They recommend using two tsp. of loose tea per cup.  I use half that and it tastes great.  Never, ever bitter!  Very smooth tasting.  I highly recommend!",5
3409,"Trying something new with this coffee. Didn't blow me away but for the price, it's excellent. I don't have anything bad to say about it other than it's a BIG bag and I am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end, but we burn thru beans pretty fast =D",5
3421,"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.  The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.  My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.",5
3422,"I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like. This brand has a wonderful flavor. I have been drinking this for about 5 years now, it is a good deal if you buy this from Amazon on auto ship. You can't beat the price.",5
3425,Best tasting green tea around a bit pricey . I tried yogi green tea because it was cheaper it was good but not a smooth and rich tasting.I will stick with Traditional Medicinal from now on.,5
3445,"I love to make sun tea with these tea bags, it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass. It is tasty and not too sweet, highly recommended!",5
3451,"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.",5
3458,its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesn't begin to measure up to all the hoopla! its well balanced but thats about it & even a little old tasting nothing special in the least what sweet caramel finish? can't believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about,5
3459,"This tea has a nice flavor, although it is hard to say if it is actually increasing my joint comfort.  The power of placebo can be just as powerful, if not more so, than any herb or medicine out there.",5
3465,I have tried alot of Jasmine teas and by far this is the best I have tried.  Everyone I share this with agrees.,5
3468,"For coffee drinkers who buy Maxwell House coffee, this is a deal!  Buy two cases for just over $50!  Free shipping, too!  Seriously, you know I stocked up!",5
3476,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.,5
3490,"these are excellent quality bags (heavy, tight weave)--minimal, if any, floaties. (i use them, primarily, for tea.) ...if you decide to purchase them, you won't be disappointed.",5
3494,"I like this tea. It's one of the better green teas I have tasted. It has a smooth and subtle flavor. I definitely enjoy it more than Bigelow's green tea, and it compares favorably to other brands as well. The packaging is also very elegant. I don't really have much more to say about this tea. Try it, you might like it.",5
3495,"My favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave.  This Organic stevia has a bit of taste of both.  The main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia.  This makes it really sweet with no aftertaste.  In fact, you can say that it almost has a hint of honey (must be the agave inulin)  It dissolves quickly too.  A packet equals 2 tsp of sugar.  I like 1 tsp in my cup of coffe so I use only half a packet at a time.  It is very good though.  Considering that it is organic and natural, the price is slightly above what I would pay, but I think it's ok if you're used to buying other products with stevia.  Truvia costs about 50 cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets, but truvia is not organic.  So it depends on what you're looking for.",5
3499,"I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE!",5
3500,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.  White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.  I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).",5
3507,This tea has a wonderful flavor!! The price is right. And I love that they dont use staples on the bags. i can just throw the used ones right into the compost pit. Jasmine and green tea were meant to be together.,5
3509,I bought some of this tea at Jungle Jims and absolutely love the frangrance as it is steeping and the taste is wonderful. I even make it into iced tea.,5
3511,"These k-cups are a quick and tasty way to make a hot cup of cider. I have tried several brands of k-cup cider and this is by far the best, the caramel flavor is also very good.",5
3517,"Was buying the Kona Blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof. Tried several different K-Cup coffees until I found the Fog Chaser. Now I have it on my subscribe and save list. I have it sent to my office, my home, my son's home every month. It ain't Kona but it is almost as bold, the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time. And at 1/2 the price of the Kona, it is the ""best bang for the buck"". I'll never go back.",5
3519,"I was a bit skeptical at getting another brand than Green Mountain brands, since Grove Square and San Fran Bay were really bad. Besides the original problem they had with the production on their first boxes, Brooklyn Beans have been a great new find for us. I could go through each blend, but they are all similar to other GMCR brands. The k cups seem a little lighter in weight and the lighter roasts  did seem watery for the travel cup size, but that is about the norm with all k cups. The best thing I really like is the company actually responds and fixes any problems. So, stop complaining about the shipping when you are leaving feedback on the product! (I always get my shipments at least 2 days ahead of scheduled date.) So, don't be afraid to try these and save money. Subscribe and save another 5%.",5
3527,"This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had.  I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside).  I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.  When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.  I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!  Highly recommend!!!",5
3537,"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.",5
3540,"The shipment was Prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2. I love dark french roast coffee, but, this coffee tasted burnt and additionally, the flavor had overtones of trash Indonesian.  Not a pleasant experience.",5
3547,"This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the brand Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the ""masala"" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.  As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!",5
3550,"My wife and I love this coffee.  The taste is awesome, the hint of mocha makes the coffee sooo smooth.",5
3552,"It does sweeten,  but there is an aftertaste when used in coffee or tea that is made with a weak taste.",5
3556,This tea tastes fantastic! The flavour is not bitter at all as with other green teas and I keep brewing the same leaves about 3-4 times a day and still get really excellent flavour!  The packaging was also great as it came in a sealable pouch that kept the leavs fresh. Will definitely continue to purchase this tea in the future.,5
3558,I didn't like the taste of this at all. I tried the Stevia packets before and didn't like them and I thought this would taste better because of the vanilla flavor but I still didn't like it.,5
3562,"We love making special coffees and this just added a great touch to them. Also we have put it on top of our soy ice cream and found it to have a nice taste on that as well;)OH we have also added it to our soda, making vanilla coke, vanilla dr. pepper and vanilla orange soda.. Very Very NICE:)",5
3568,I really enjoy it. Is not my favorite Colombian coffee but is really closer to the No. 1.  Suddenly the price has been going up so much,5
3569,"Read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy, but Generation Pu-erh tea was surprisingly nice, much nicer than green tea. I'm very happy with this product.  And the service was exceptional, shipping incredibly FAST! Thanks!",5
3580,"Outstanding product.  The greattea gives me a warm comfotable feeling and makes my senses come alive  The bags are quite large,that's a good thing because I get a bigger cup of tea with full flavor.  Just Fantastic!!!",5
3588,"So far this is the best affordable coffee we found in the US. Before we had ""Coffee Bean Direct Sumatra Mandheling, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag"" which we didn't like at all. But it still doesn't reach the coffee we had in Europe.",5
3589,"I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's K-Cups, so far all the ones I've tried haven't left my stomach churning..and,  this was my first time trying out the Sorrento Fair Trade Roast and purchased it on a Warehouse Amazon price deal.  I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast = A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the ""shhhakes"" either, it has that right ""balance"" you need with your daily cup of coffee.  Yes, I will be getting another 24-Count of this when I am finished with this pack!  5-Stars!",5
3591,"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours.",5
3597,"This is a very nice green tea.  I had to try it since I love anything mango.  The flavor is perfect whether its hot or iced or with some creamer.  It smells amazing as well, just like a real mango!  I'd like it if the packing was more eco-friendly like Celestial Seasonings, but its still pretty nice.  The packets are individually sealed and there are no staples on on the bag so you don't get any weird taste added to the tea.",5
3603,"I first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at Christmas time. I went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea. I love the peppermint & ginger and I love the fresh new bud taste of white tea, over green tea leaves (Same plant, different part). This tea has it all. Mildly spicy, and smooth yet refreshing. I practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones. This is my number one all time favorite!",5
3604,This coffee is very strong tasting. We cut it in half with regular coffee and it still tastes wonderful. It makes the house smell like maple syrup as it is brewing but the taste is not too much! Love it!,5
3607,I have never been disappointed with a Cafe Excellence Product.  This has a nutty vanilla flavor with no oily aftertaste like so many flavored coffees have.,5
3609,"The Coffee Beans are great. Fresh, and shipped fast. Great prices. Will continue to order these coffee beans as long as they stay fresh and reasonably priced.",5
3616,"I just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge.  I pre-sweetened it with some simple syrup, making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as I don't care for super sweet tea.  I'm not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas I have had in restaurants.  I do wish there was no artificial food coloring (yellow).",5
3620,I love the flavor that this hot chocolate has.  It is very rich and smooth.  Have tried other brands but did not get the results I wanted.  I will definately be ordering from this company again.,5
3626,"I was introduced to a peach-flavored iced latte at work, and decided I wanted to try and made them at home.  This syrup worked great!  Highly recommended!",5
3628,"Melitta's rich, flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag. It is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour. Highly recommended.",5
3629,"Very delicious coffee, thankfully Amazon sells this flavor now.  I have been waiting for it since I tasted this last year.  I like the fact that you sell it in a 2 Pack rather than a single.",5
3639,"Exceptional coffee all around - rich, full, with subtle hints of dark chocolate. My coffee-snob neighbor just ordered 4 pounds herself after having just one cup!",5
3643,"When I opened the package, I thought this tea smells exactly like Italian pignoli macaroons.  But, the taste is definitely ""darker"" and more bitter; perhaps I let it steep too long, or perhaps sweetener would bring out the ""cookie"" flavor more.  Whatever.  Black, it tastes pretty similar to the Republic of Tea Vanilla Almond flavor, which I also like.  This tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas, BTW, so it's probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings.",5
3645,"Exactly what Thai Iced tea should be. I love how each tea bag is individually wrapped allowing me to take the tea anywhere for me to brew. Keep in mind, packaging can be misleading though showing the tea with milk. This tea doesn't have milk in it and you'll need to add it yourself. Aside from that, the product itself is excellent though.",5
3651,"Good looking, good hand feeling, stable with cold and hot water shift; I got them within 48 hours after I placed the order.",5
3665,This is my favorite tea of all brands and all flavors. I drink it cold with no sweeteners of any kind. Of course everyone's preferences for food and drinks are different so well someone may say they dont like...,5
3677,"These are very good!  I can't say which is my favorite flavor, but I'm leaning towards the Key Lime. When I read the review and description I figured they'd be crispy, but they are normal shortbread with little chips or ""snaps"" you might say of flavor.  I love the packaging of the four flavors as well. I will be reordering.",5
3683,"This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate/Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.  I too am sorry I couldn't buy just 1 lb. to try it first -- Now I am stuck with this awful coffee I cannot return.  SO, BUYER BEWARE -- NO RETURNS!",5
3685,"This was one of the first K cup boxes I bought, was not disappointed. It tastes great, like coffee is supposed to. Not too strong, not too weak...great flavor. Will be buying more.",5
3690,"I have been a loyal Coffee Bean Direct Customer for a couple years now. We mostly prefer the Dark Sumatra, but have tried a few others as well. We find the Dark Sumatra to be the boldest, while very low in acid. This means you can make it as strong as you like without the upset stomach. Highly recommend both the Dark Sumatra and the seller.",5
3710,"at first, i thought i wouldn't like these.  i like fig newtons but i don't love them.  however, i couldn't be more pleased.  first of all, my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie.  i immediately checked the ingredients and yep, there's oats in there !  absolutely delicious. there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it's not like a spread.  now i am not sure if  it's supposed to be spread between 2 thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kinda hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley, there is very little fig so it's not that big of a deal.  i couldn't taste the honey but that's ok. i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that.  they are a nice size and crisp.  i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious.  my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too.  he didn't even taste the fig. these are very good however, if you really really want to taste fig, get the regular fig newtons.",5
3716,"This tea is among the best i have ever had! I am a tea addict, and the delightful licorice flavor running through this tea makes it delicious!",5
3719,easy to use  and nice tast u can add ice cream it will be great taste .,5
3746,Love this coffee . No problems brewing .Cannot beat the price realy good coffee and afordable.customer service was top notch .We raise our coffee cup to you,5
3767,The best product yet for Tassimo.  I only wish it made a larger cup of coffee.,5
3775,Taste much better than the regular Apple Cider.  I look forward to drinking a cup at night after work.  Smells great too!,5
3784,"I have made this a couple times. I use the recipe on the back that includes chicken. I love the subtle lime flavor. My husband worried because it was Thai that it would be spicy, but it has just the right amount of flavors.",5
3787,chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and Apriva. chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.,5
3790,"Five pounds of beans is a lot of coffee. The ""Dark Brazilian"" beans seem to sit somewhere between a columbian and french roast. The flavor is very nice and makes a nice cup of dark brew.",5
3793,"I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.",5
3794,This coffe was over priced and not a true French roast. I would not describe it as dark or bold in flavor.  Would have been helpful if a price per pod was added.,5
3799,I received a small box of these Ginger and Honey crystals and I fell in love with them! What a great way to bump up your cup of hot tea. They are strong and I would recommend starting with a small portion. I ordered two bags of thirty packs and now my Daughter in Law wants a 30 Pack. Love It!,5
3802,These cups were difficult to cap (putting the lids on securely was a comedy show) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig; the water went everywhere.  Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o' Joe = I'm not a very happy buyer.,5
3809,I bought this for my mother who tasted the tea in a restaurant.  This is now her favorite tea.,5
3814,I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.,5
3817,"I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee.",5
3818,"I love Arizona iced tea, and this one is quite tasty, especially for a diet version.  A great combination of lemony tea.  Please note that this review is specific to the product, not the price or the merchant.",5
3826,I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again.,5
3832,I bought this product because I knew I liked sumatran coffee . Im new to roasting coffee but I roasted these beans many different degrees and cant get much flavor out of them. I sorry I bought 5# and will probably throw 4# away.,5
3834,I have written to this company to try to get an answer as to why I was overcharged for this coffee. I do not recommend buying this product until Liquid Nation is NOT ALLOWED to sell it.,5
3836,"This product is the usual Gevalia finely ground coffee.  Full-strength it did not seem be all that great. I enjoyed it much better when I blended the product with 'regular' coffee. Maybe it is just the way I brew coffee that is wrong, or I have the wrong kind of brewer (basket instead of cone, like the Gevalia-brand brewers). I am not a big fan of flavored coffee, of any brand, because I think they processor can mask poor-grade product with fancy additives.  It has very good dark-chocolate flavor. I am not sure how good a value it will as I do not have access to that info at this point.",5
3838,"I tried peach tea at a Cracker Barrel near me and loved it.  I found it here at Amazon and bought my 6 pack and have gone thru more than half in less than two months.  I love the taste and being instant, can be made very easily for a quick drink.  I think I like this better then ice tea with lemon even and that is a favorite. Thanks for the good price Amazon and quick shipping.",5
3845,This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.,5
3859,Great tasting and a nice medium roast. This coffee is a great deal for the price. We really like the export also but for 1/2 the price this is a winner.,5
3860,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it, so I'll give it a 4/5.  This isn't just tea, there is powdered milk involved too.  I was surprised, so if that isn't your thing...",5
3864,"I really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup. I can brew one cup and get a full size cup, unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee. In the mornings, I want a full cup of coffee to go. I don't want to full around with a small sample. Besides that, the taste suits me. We have tried lots of the others, but I have since settled on this one for my taste. Try it! I think you will agree with me.",5
3870,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha.",5
3892,"I was so happy to find the Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice on amazon.com.  It is a seasonal product that I absolutely fell in love with over Christmas!  Some of the other pumpkin spice flavored K-cups that I have tried smelled really nice, but had absolutely no flavor.  This one fills the kitchen with that spicy aroma and has a full flavor!  I even run through a 2nd shot on smaller cup size.  It has that much flavor!",5
3902,"I normally drink half-caff and am very pleased with it, but after trying a sample of the Tully's French Roast decaf that came in a variety pack, I was truly AMAZED at the flavor.  I anticipated it being bland, not much taste but I was sooo wrong.  The flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times I checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated! Although I will continue to drink the half-caf, this product has taken the #1 spot on my coffee list!",5
3906,I started drinking this tea about 1-1/2 weeks ago and have seen my acne slowly fade away.  My co-workers even mentioned how bright my complexion was looking.,5
3921,My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.,5
3929,This is a great tasting coffee.  It gets my day started off on the right foot.,5
3937,The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.,5
3941,"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money.",5
3982,"Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone.",5
3985,I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.,5
3986,"Very pleased with the smooth, not-too-weak, slightly bolder taste of this Yuban Dark Roast.  Right where I like the taste of my coffee, at a price point that I can enjoy as well.  Low acidity too.  Perfect!",5
3998,One of the best taste coffee so far. No bitter taste like other coffee have. Highly recommend for coffee lovers.,5
4017,"I've fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. Get this one. I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend. The disinfectant taste was back. I would not buy this one again.",5
4020,"Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!",5
4028,"I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. I'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag.",5
4032,"I loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting. Everyone in the office eats it now. We only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks, but so far I have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor.  If you like a bright, citrus-y taste that is not too overpowering, you will love this. If you like a more minty gum, then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum.",5
4035,"Love this coffee!  I've always enjoyed ""good"" coffee but this is great coffee. A friend sent it to me as a gift, and I'm so happy he turned me onto it.  The coffee is strong (the way I like it) and has a smooth, rich flavor. I know what I'll be buying for my friends this holiday.",5
4042,This is probably the best tea I have had and this brand is always a winner.  So far I am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while I am experimenting looking for my perfect taste I have found it to be great weak or strong.  Depending on my mood I like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used.  My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.  They usually claim it is too strong with how much I use but for me it is perfect.  This is a pack of six so make sure you will like this kind before purchasing.,5
4046,"Despite what others are saying about these teas, they are DELICIOUS! It is the perfect amount of sweetness. The Peach ones are my favorite. The flavor isn't too strong, but you can definitely taste it. A lot healthier than drinking a flavored iced tea with diabetes amounts of sugar!",5
4058,Tasty! Great breakfast blend. Not too terribly strong. Would recommend. Well worth the price. Will order more soon. Buy it.,5
4063,"I received this item as part of a gift during the Christmas Holidays.  I enjoyed it so much I got on the internet and searched until I found it.  Although it may not be everyones ""cup of tea,"" it will become a regular part of the holidays at my house!!!",5
4071,"I wouldn't mind paying the price if the coffee was any good. The beans smell like burnt coffee, unlike any other French Roast I have picked up. This leads to a very bitter and burnt taste throughout. There is simply nothing special about this expensive coffee.",5
4076,"Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter- I like bitter but I didn't like this. It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a ""cringe"" kind of taste.  I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off... I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.  Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.  It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.  No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.  You can go down to the local ""name of popular coffee shop here"" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.  Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..  If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special.",5
4093,"While I don't like this as well as Rose's Lime Marmalade, and can't help wondering why the ""Lemon Lime"" actually looks greener than the straight ""Lime,"" it still makes a tasty spread.",5
4100,this is my favorite lipton tea sadly all the stores in my town have stopped selling it so I have resorted to buying it at Amazon lets pray they don't stop offering it.,5
4113,"I'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a Starbucks (I drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk). Great coffee for a great price, especially if you get it when Amazon is offering the $3 off coupon.",5
4123,"This syrup is a graet value!  The bigger more expensive coffee shops use this same syrup to flavor their coffee drinks, with ""additional"" expense to the consumer.  Bottles are plastic instead of glass for easier shipping to consumer.  Have these auto shipped to my home every three months.",5
4131,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.  In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.  I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).  This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.",5
4138,"So often in the movies, when something upsetting happens, the first thing offered is a cup of tea.  There's just something soothing about it.  I'm no connoisseur, but I decided to branch out and try something a little exotic.  I'm glad I did, as this tea is really nice.  I like mine with a little honey and milk.  So good!",5
4140,"great taste, greater tasting, greats tastes, greating tasteeses, greate tastee, greatr taster, greatt tastet, greaty tastey, greati tastei, greatm tastem",5
4146,"I've never been a coffee drinker so I've always ignored Keurig machines. I got these since my office has a machine and really enjoy it. The tea tastes perfectly brewed. If you like English tea and have access to a Keurig, this is worth the purchase price.",5
4147,"I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.  So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.  Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend.",5
4149,This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.,5
4151,This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had! I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring. Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!,5
4158,"Have been using this bean to make the morning mocha's for about 6 months, its a good quality bean.  Makes a nice dark flavorful espresso with good crema. Highly recommended.",5
4159,I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.,5
4161,"this brand has always amazed people with their coffee flavors, and the vermont country blend is just one of them, my husband and i tried it for the 1st time and we loved it....",5
4164,"This is a great stand-in when you can't make it out to Starbucks.  Love having an instant version at home.  Love, love, love it.",5
4166,"I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.  We have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips.  Now I have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn't go to waste.",5
4167,This tea is very tasty. It doesn't have the unappealing fresh paint smell that some other Thai tea mixes have. I'm very pleased with it. I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream. The lovely orange color shows up better when you use cream or milk and the color is part of the charm of the drink.,5
4168,"Recently enjoyed these teas at a high end restaurant. after returning home we ordered some more online , they arrived promptly and were just as delicious.",5
4169,This is definitely my all time favorite flavored Keurig k-cup.  Pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.,5
4170,This is a great-tasting tea! The taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak. I will be purchasing more.,5
4174,"I drink this tea all day long and its really good. Needs no flavoring, but sometimes I do add a little honey and make it into iced tea. That is yummy. Most times I drink it hot.",5
4176,This is great tasting coffee.  I've been buying Melitta coffee for over twenty years and it's the only brand of coffee I will buy.  It's great that I can order it through Amazon.,5
4177,I am a real coffee lover and am hooked on Senseo coffee.  My regular coffee pot is gathering dust in the corner of my kitchen.  I recently tried Sumatra and just fell in love with it.  If you like the real taste of coffee you'll love it as much as I do.  Highly recommend this.,5
4180,This coffee is not to strong but strong enough and has great flavor.  We love it.,5
4184,"Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it!",5
4193,"For the price you cant beet it. It is not to sweet, but enough to have some flavor, and it really does taste like root beere.",5
4207,"I tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the Palmer House in Chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn. Sorry I had to purchase six as I can't even give them away. Absolutely no taste whatsoever, even when you use a massive amount of it on popcorn. Don't waste your money.",5
4211,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.  By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.",5
4213,This tastes exactly like the white hot cocoa I've always gotten from my coffee shop...have I found their source?  Would definitely recommend.,5
4217,"Not sure if it works, but taste is good, like a caramel. :) First got it in china Town, desided to buy again",5
4222,"I made this purchase for a visiting relative and although I did not drink it, she enjoyed the tea very much and ordered her own when she returned home.",5
4225,"i love this tea its got a great taste and doesn't leave you all jumpy and wired after you drink it. the ONLY thing i have against this tea is that it is cut very small, small enough to drift out of my infuser and leave a bunch of loose tea in my tea...",5
4230,"Marley's Mellow Mood is fantastic, not only does it taste great but it really works, best thing since sliced bread, I highly recommend you try some.",5
4237,This is one of the best coffees I have ever had for my Keurig.  It is a nice smooth coffee.  And the price is the best price I could find.  I will be buying more.,5
4238,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion. This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.,5
4240,My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.,5
4249,If you like Kahlua this is a great coffee.  The aroma is wonderful as it brews and the flavor is mild - not overpowering.,5
4260,I drink this tea to relax and for stomach and digestive problems. It works every time. Very calming and a good all-around tea time.,5
4266,This is the best tasting and best price on a stevia product that I have found.,5
4278,"Went to italy this past summer and again in september. So I became addicted to expresso, and ordered about 150 worth of pods when i got back.. and i really really enjoyed this one. My father and grandfather also like it (born and raised in italy). Will be ordering again.",5
4279,Using Keurig cups is so great but also expensive.  It is a luxury I will have to give up after retirement but the ease of trying so many different coffees is really great and I have enjoyed the coffee and the makers immensely.,5
4293,"The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess I'll just have to get used to other brands!",5
4295,"I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!",5
4297,I work from home and drink aobut 5-6 cups off K-Cup coffee a day. This is good tasting coffee and the lowest price K-Cup on the market!,5
4300,"If you are already a fan of illy coffee in general (whole bean, ground, espresso), most likely you'll enjoy this can of Cappucino Coffee.  The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected?  There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.  The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.  I only received one can as part of the Vine program, but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will, without doubt, purchase further cans of it.",5
4305,I have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers.  Although I did not find this the best version of Earl Grey out there it was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  For a system that can provide me with Tea at a moments notice I am quite pleased.  You can't expect something that provides you convenience like the Tassimo to produce the same results as hand brewing from a tea bag or leaves.,5
4306,"I actually loved this flavor, I bought one of each of argo tea flavors from my local store; I liked this one the most.  Im not sure what kind of tastes the other two reviewers have, but im amazed that they hated it so much.  The mint and lime mix together wonderfully, it might even mix well with gin.  I noticed the mint flavor at first, followed by a tart lime flavor at the end.  I will be buying more.  According to the bottle its made with ""Armeniam Mint tea,"" not black tea as one of the reviewers noted.",5
4308,My second purchase of this  cofee & like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to.  Not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with,5

4314,"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?",5
4319,Wayyyyy overpriced! K cups should average you around .50 cents a cup ! ! !,5
4322,"I love this chai...it is the best on the market.  I was sick of spending $4 almost daily, so I decided to make them at home instead.  BEST CHOICE EVER!  I use hot water and frothed milk, sprinkle with cinnamon, and it tastes like my favorite bakery chai!  Also, I highly recommend this seller...I received the chai on the next business day.  Extremely satisfied customer.",5
4328,"This is $14 worth of creamer at best. Sams Club has 50 oz of coffeemate creamer for only $6.32 this is 110 oz of creamer for $51, Do the math.",5
4334,This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!,5
4338,"My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin.",5
4342,"I grew up with Lipton tea, so maybe at 67 I'm addicted. I love the taste and how it does not get bitter if I leave the teabag in too long.",5
4347,"I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, Chai tea and this tea is a nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle. I've had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere.",5
4351,I love my Tassimo Coffee machine and I love the Gevalia Signature Blend Coffee.  It is great any time of day.  Never bitter or over bearing.. always smooth and mild.  I have been using it for over 2 years now and the coffee is brewed the same for every cup.  I highly recommend Tassimo machine and Gevalia Signature blend coffee.,5
4354,"This Jam is amazing, great flavor...great texture and spreads well on anything. Might I suggest to put it in some vanilla ice cream for your very own Huckleberry Ice cream...  Definitely recommend this product...now only if i bought more....",5
