1988,"If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing."
3943,"I am disappointed in this product. First, there's a distinct aftertaste. Secondly, it is not as sweet as they promise, and doesn't work at all in cold drinks.  If you need a sugar substitute I suggest Somersweet, not perfect either but better than this.   Sorry I was taken in by the promises."
1858,Calorie count is good. The orange smoothie is the best.  These bars used to be sold by costco. They are much moister than other bars.
725,"These taste great. Very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies. 10 lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it's a great value if you're a ""natural"" candy lover. This comes shipped in a plastic bag so I recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage (2 gallon size or thereabouts)."
2183,"These diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant, non-sticky crunch. With 6 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber to 6 grams of sugar and only 120 calories, they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so-called diet products.  I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.  Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening. These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too."
