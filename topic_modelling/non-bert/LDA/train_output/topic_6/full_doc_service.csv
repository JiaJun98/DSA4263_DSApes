15,I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund. I was very please with the seller's response.,4
17,"My husband and I love to cook.  Jarred sun-dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment.  Not these! Flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes.  The flavor is a burst of summer sweetness. Often, these are eaten as ""chef's treats"" during cooking.  Price is more than fair.  I will keep  these on hand always.",4
20,"This was the first time we've had tings - a friend told us about them and since since they ended up being 2.17 per bag - we gave them a shot.  My daughter has a severe milk intolerance and I have a wheat allergy - and it's rare to find something delicious that we can both have.  My daughter is 2 years old and can now enjoy cheetos just like her friends - and they taste wonderful!  I'm so thankful for products like these that taste good, help us feel normal, and are affordable!  If I could give 6 stars I would!",4
21,Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.,4
22,Does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy? I'm still hunting for a cracker I don't have to make. Their website is unclear about it's source.,4
25,"You can by at Kroger at half the price. Used to be cheaper before recent price hike, just continued from innertia to order until payed attention, people be careful!",4
27,I bought this for my 6yo sound to take to school for his birthday. He is really into space and since he is in kindergarten I wanted his first birthday treat at school to be super special. Everyone loved it and he had a really fun experience.,4
29,I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is broken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.,4
33,"I've heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before.  I never quite knew what they meant until now.  This really does taste like cardboard.  I don't think I could give these a way.  They are trash.  Don't waste your money. Here is a better low carb sweet snack  Blue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)",4
38,Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!,4
47,I needed some of these in a rush and ordered online. There is no difference between this and the ones I get in the store locally except the price which is 10 times more.,4
53,"We travel to VA frequently. I used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home. Now I just order from Amazon to arrive on the day we get home - the price is much less and no shipping hassles. The quality is excellent, I've tried the Costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as Planters or others.",4
57,"This is an outstandingly good cereal. It is not too sweet, is delicious, and healthy, too. A nice choice for anyone wanting to live a healthy life.",4
67,"This product is well worth the money.  Others carry a similar product that's cheaper, but the quality is way cheaper also.",4
72,"I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.  Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly!",4
74,"I tried a pack randomly today at Starbucks.  I wanted something different from the banana bread or chocolate-covered graham crackers that I would otherwise buy.  This is some solid trail mix.  I highly recommend.  As a matter of fact, I am on amazon now to buy more of it so I can let friends try.",4
77,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???",4
78,"Had this fabulous oil at my daughters wedding at Frankies in Brooklyn, NY... just had to order some. Extremely fast delivery and they even included a personal note.... highly recommend.",4
80,One of the few soy milks my slightly milk allergic kids will drink consistently.  Easy to carry and just the right amount per box.  Price on Amazon is quite a bit cheaper than the pice in our local stores.,4
82,"I love the quantity and flavor of this tea. It's a little messy opening the pouches, the matcha can get all over your fingers and counter, but oh well. I purchase this at Costco, because the price is WAY better. My only complaint, is that I wish it were Organic.",4
83,Living in the city it is hard to find pectin at the local grocery so this is a great price and delivered right to my door!,4
95,"It's Splenda, and at a good price.  Forget about the individual packets, the cost will kill you.  If you use the product, this is the way to buy it.",4
98,"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes.",4
100,"I received these pistachios as a Christmas present. They are fantastic! I can't seem to stop eating them, and neither can anyone else in the family. My adult son had never tried pistachios before eating these, and now loves them, too. I will definitely be ordering more of these.",4
102,"Great to have a sugar that tastes great, cooks with everything, and has not yet been cooped by the GMO crowd of producers.  We'll order again, and enjoyed the speedy delivery.  We wish this came in larger bags, for truly bulk orders.  25 lbs bags would be great.",4
105,"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger ""house"" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.  I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat. I have had stronger chargers which worked better and lasted longer than this model the fido 525cs.",4
109,I had these when in the Phillippines and then when I came had to have some more.  Even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks.,4
113,"Aweful! They arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement! The bags' supposed re-sealable zipper,didn't re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again, I cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was!",4
117,Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.,4
142,It really rastes great. No real aftertaste either like some other energy drinks. Color is fun as well and makes for a great mixer. I will order again.,4
151,This company is VERY accommodating and was quick to re-ship my missing UPS shipped order.  The general manager took care of the problem personally and quickly.  This company definitely has my future business.  They have a fantastic product and even better customer service!,4
154,"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area.",4
161,"I first purchased this product at BJ's wholesale club. This is the best flavored carbonated water I've ever had. Like other reviewers, BJ's discontinued in favor of another product, what a mistake! I wrote to Talking Rain and their new president requesting this product have an online outlet...and it seems they delivered. Yes, it is more expensive, but with super saver shipping and subscription service (15%) savings, I'm in for a few cases each month. Try it, you will love it.",4
166,"This is excellent quality caster sugar, very fine.  Great price.  Is a must have for making shortbread cookies.",4
172,"These little things are delicious! I didn't expect much. My wife bought them apparently, and they were just sitting on the kitchen table. She must not have told me about them because she figured I'd eat them all. If that's the case, she's probably right. These things definitely exceeded all my expectations, and were good enough for me to immediately come here and right a review. They do seem pretty pricey here though, but I'm not sure what they run in the stores since I didn't buy them personally.",4
179,"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet.",4
180,"Super tasty and super easy to make, healthy too! I can only recommend this one to anyone who wants organic yummy pancakes with healthy fibers in too.",4
181,"These taste great and are pretty addictive, but this same box was about $5 at my local Ralph's supermarket. Don't buy this from Amazon!",4
182,"This is the second best bar I've ever had, just after Labrada's Cinnamon Bun Cookie Roll. Perfect for hiking as it stays soft and delicious when it's cold out and doesn't melt in the sun. Love these things.",4
183,"I purchased this via Amazon, because I am NEVER sure I will be able to find it locally, and not have it cost an arm a leg and firstborn male child.  You cant beat the price, and the knowledge I will not have to comb the grocery stores looking made it a win win!  Not only that but each container I received had a 50 cent coupon attached, so if I DO find it locally I can enjoy a great discount!",4
185,"This jam tastes as if it was made of anything but roses.  No aroma at all. By the time you pay for the shipping, may as well buy something else in the local grocery store.",4
187,"I enjoyed the taste of No Fear, but I can't say that it gave me any more energy than the other energy drinks on the market today.  Since I do, occasionally, indulge in a few energy drinks from time to time, I can say it delivered as much energy as other supplement brands. The four stars were mainly for the taste.",4
188,I was weary of buy food through the mail. This was a great purchase. Great taste and great price. I will be looking for other great deals.,4
199,"i ate the graham crackers and they were delicious.  i shared the graham crackers with lana and she said also that the graham crackers were delicious.  both lana and i agreed on the strong oats taste and a lingering graham cracker taste, less subtle than other graham crackers.  i asked lana if this was a cracker she would use for the crust of a banana cream or key lime pie.  with no hesitation she said yes.  this is a wonderful alternative snack to cookies and chips.  lana is with me in highly recommending BACK TO NATURE GOLDEN HONEY OAT GRAHAMS.",4
208,"I got a call from my mother-in-law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.  Won't buy again,  Steve Baker",4
214,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.,4
216,I am new to coconut oil....the cost is what kept me from trying it sooner.  This is the best deal I've ever run across and the product is excellent!,4
217,"These are better than ""regular"" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the ""aftermath"" that typically comes with eating.  My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like ""normal"" pretzels.",4
218,"GoPicnic is a wonderful option for my college aged daughter.  She never really stops to eat, and when she does finally give into hunger it's usually not good food.  She loves the convenience of the packaging and the freshness of  GoPicnic.  I appreciate the nutrition in each package.  The new Salmon and Crackers is one of her favorites.",4
220,These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months.  Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips.  They've got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer.  The bulk box of 15 bags is also the most economical purchase I've found.,4
231,"I am really enjoying this coffee. It tastes excellent, was nicely priced and the company has gone out of their way to provide excellent customer service after some initial problems.  I am going to get this monthly on subscribe and save and I do recommend it now. the brooklyn bridge and breakfast blend are very nice!",4
233,"These things are better than steak.. filet mignon! It was well worth the purchase of this package. It saves you a couple bucks versus buying them in the store. Go ahead, splurge yourself and get some.",4
234,I used these to make several small batches of vanilla sugar for Christmas presents. Worked great and very affordable. Thanks!,4
235,I take 5 a day and will update when my bloodwork is done again.  I am hoping for the best!  The taste is better than I thought it would be.,4
236,"Anyone shopping for chives in the grocery store knows how expensive chives are. I'm almost surprised restaurants don't charge extra for them. These chives are a ""steal"" compared to the grocery, and taste as good as McCormick's at probably a 1/4 of the price. Also the shipping was very fast. I would buy again without a doubt.",4
237,"First off, I didn't purchase this product through Amazon, but at a local grocery store, so my review only reflects the product itself, not Amazon in any way.  I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didn't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  I've been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.  I did email customer service at O.N.E. the day I drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if I got a bad batch, and they still haven't replied to me.",4
239,"Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.  The beans were thin and almost dry.  Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper...",4
243,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money.",4
244,"I purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. The product has no sweet smell as one would expect. I have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier, no response.",4
249,This was the second time I've ordered the 5lbs bag from Amazon. Both times I've gotten the freshest Good & Plenty's I've ever gotten. I get them at the store or at the movies and they are tough even hard. I loved them and thought that's just how they came until I had them soft and chewy. Awesome!,4
250,"My wife and I absolutely love these snacks.  They're somewhat ""healthy"" and they're very tasty.  After we purchased these we found them cheaper at Wal-Mart.  Since then though, Wal-mart went with a cheaper ""clone"" from another company.  It comes in a plastic container, has the exact same ingredients, and the price is a lot less than the name brand item.",4
260,"Item appears to be Keurig brand by title & description (big $$$).  However upon receiving it, it is an off brand ""My Perfect Kitchen"" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :)",4
261,"My daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and I have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure, organic, pureed fruits!  The packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too.  All the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount Starbucks now carries the line in-store.  ;)",4
264,"These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.",4
274,These are tasty.  Great Strawberry flavor.  Nice and crisp and only 100 calories.  I buy these on the subscription plan to save even more money.  I even ship these to my daughters!,4
283,These are tasty snacks that are healthy for you.  They're a bit pricey unless you buy them on sale and in bulk.,4
286,"Product is ok, but I consider it very expensive for a small plastic item!  If I had seen the product in person, I never would have paid that much for it.",4
287,My husband loves these. They are easy to make and yield consistent results. Easy to customize the strength by just using more or less water. We bring a few packets when we go away on weekend trips. Buying in bulk here is definitely cheaper than buying at the store. Cheers!,4
298,"The pancakes were delicious, but they weren't as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, I'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps.",4
301,"My 7 months old enjoys all earth's best products so I decided to get this one too. He really likes it although I think his favorite is apples and apricots. Like all the other products I bought from this brand, I wasn't disappointed.",4
304,Dogs love the taste and I love the company. Especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home.,4
309,Justin's individual nut butter packs are delicious and perfect for back packing trips! I bring them every time without dissatisfaction. Highly recommended product.,4
312,Product was just as promised. I would purchase it again. They are good. They are great. I sugest them. That is all I can write about this product.,4
322,"I should've done my research first. Basically over a $1 per jar. I can get a WAY better deal by going to the store. Total ripoff!  I will continue to buy Beech Nut, just not from this person.",4
324,"The exact same brand of rice is available at our local store for a 1/4th of the price. The current price on here is a whopping $73.15 not including shipping. Yikes! :o It's decent rice, the last time I bought it, it lasted over a year, we kept it in the closet, just folded the top part up, and put something decently heavy on it since it's not really easy to seal back up after you've opened it.",4
325,"These cherries arrived promptly, taste great, and were completely as advertised.  We broke the package down into smaller quantities and froze them.  Would buy again, and will when the need arises.",4
331,Taste is much better than competing brands and has a good shelf life.  Subscribe and save lets you be sure to always have the right amount on hand at the best price.,4
334,This is my new favorite coffee!  And the price is a great value too.  I first tried this coffee from a local grocery store and was thrilled that I can purchase it through Amazon in 80 ct package at a great price.,4
345,I love this soup. Very hard to find in Florida. Thank You Amazon for stocking it,4
349,"I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would.",4
351,You can buy the same bag of chocolate at any Michaels store for $2.99.  I got a ton of bags on sale for $1.99 there!  Don't waste your money or your time waiting for this bag,4
352,These are incredibly good. I can't seem to keep a package of these around very long. My family and friends seem to get to them if I don't.,4
353,Good quality product.  I was having difficulty finding Hungarian Paprika in the local markets.  Amazon offered a wide variety of this product.  The multi-container offer was set at a good price.  I'm quite satisfied.  I would order it again.,4
355,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.,4
360,"These were really tasty, some might even say habit forming. The only thing is that they are a little expensive. My family loved them so I'll likely purchase them again.",4
361,"Just received my shipment - ""best by"" date is June of 2012 and it's mid-March.  Even though it's only me, I'm pretty sure I'll use most of it by the time June rolls around.  Tasted just like the Starbucks pods I've purchased locally (before the stores stopped carrying them).  Definitely no complaints.",4
371,I'm so excited to see Bobo bars here.  They are my favorite of all the healthy snack bars and usually have a hard time finding them where I live. Hooray for Bobo's!  PS....Amazon DOES need to work out some of their shipping problems.,4
373,Caused a fight over who was getting what lol. Perfect gift and have told many others to check out this box and the others they have available. Very quick delivery,4
374,I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.,4
380,"""I am so impressed. This is the best price I have ever seen for this product, The quality is awesome, and they had it shipped to me so fast that I had it within a week. Fantastic price, quality and service. Don't get no better than that !!"" ( My husband and I are hooked, this is delicious. After eating this you will never go back to rolled, processed, 1-minute oatmeal !!)",4
384,"I have enjoyed Big Franks for years.  Now that Amazon carries them I can get them delivered to my door at a price (including shipping, subscription plan) that is lower than I can find anywhere else.",4
386,"I have a gluten allergy, so I am always looking for an alternative to cookies, muffins, granola bars, and other sweet snacks that I can no longer eat.  The Kind Bars are great - I have not found any that I absolutely don't like, but some I like better than others.  The Fruit and Nuts in Yogurt is definitely my favorite - I like the combination of nuts, raisins, and yogurt - it does not seem as overpoweringly sweet as some of the others. I originally discovered Kind Bars at Starbucks, but they were VERY expensive to buy on a regular basis. That was when I checked out Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, signed up for the Kind Bars, and cut my purchase cost by more than half - with no shipping cost!  What a cool program - especially for those of us with allergies who need regular access to products that are usually expensive and/or hard to find!",4
391,"I bought this pack from Amazon as I had one of the flavors at the local market and wanted to try some new ones. It tastes great. Make sure to follow the recommendations. Some flavors say ""do not shake"" and some flavors say ""shake slightly"".",4
395,"I ordered several products from Superior Nut Company including these Milk Chocolate Covered gummy bears. I was skeptical ordering something like chocolate over the mail but they arrived unscathed and very fresh. I do alot of baking and I will definitely be buying from this seller again. Fair prices, excellent product.",4
401,"I am a Dolce Gusto user for a long time, and this was the best price I could find for this product. So, I would recommend that due to that.",4
402,"These are very good, and a bargain depending on whether they are on sale. Came packed well, I don't taste the oil that other reviewers mentioned. A great snack or addition to salads.",4
403,"I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them.",4
404,"Good Product, good price, just be prepared to eat a lot of grits, lol.  I kind of got tired of grits and donated 6 boxes to a food pantry, however, it had nothing to do with the quality of the product.  12 boxes is a lot of grits to eat.  Next time I think I will spring for the variety pack with the cheese flavors in them.",4
406,"I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?",4
409,"I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!",4
416,"This is a very tasty products, I love the crunch and the favor it gets four thumbs up from me",4
419,"I originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a 'secret sister,' and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today.  The crackers, cheese spread, and pepperoni were incredibly tasty!  The dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top-off.  I immediately got online to order another variety to try!  It seems like a small meal, but it has kept me full all afternoon.  I'm going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins--seems a napkin is the one thing the GoPicnic folks forgot!  They'll be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park.  Hope the other 5 meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage!",4
424,"What's not to like?  Delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package.  I keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack.  They are very smokey-don't leave an open package in your car, like I did...It made my car smell like cigarettes.  However, this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good.",4
428,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.  This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.  I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.  As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! - However, definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box!",4
432,"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it.",4
433,"when i was first introduced to this product and business opportunity i was a little skeptical about it, but after i started drinking it i really like it i experienced good things. i didnt get any coffee jitters and crashes, plus i lost some weight like most people experience. so i decided to sign up as a representive so i can get it the products at wholesale. then as time goes i check my website and there were alot of people as my downline, then i relized that this business is really growing whether i do anything or not so i decided to purchase the bronze promotional package and i started getting on this business. my upline and leaders are a great help and im pretty much just trying to duplicate their success and its working. ive just upgraded to the silver promotional package to really get my business growing. ive made all my investment money back and some in the short time that ive been involved in og, considering that i dont do much, i just give people samples and show them the business opportunity. if you like to know more about this business give me a email at zang-xiong@hotmail.com. im more then happy to share this opportunity with anyone that is interested and looking to change their lifes.",4
439,"The Jack Link's 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!!",4
442,This Nori is a true bargain! 10 sheets of Nori at local grocery stores ran for as much as 1$ per sheet. 50 sheets at less than $10 is hard to beat. Really glad I got this as I am now making sushi several times a week!,4
451,I got this for my kids easter basket just to have something different and they loved it.  It tastes great and even travels well.  This is a great treat to take in the car or stick in a purse for that time when you are craving ice cream but can't have it.,4
458,the flakes are like eating twigs and straw I contacted company and they said would send coupons to replace my product but I never got any thing in the mail ever,4
473,"Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by ""Godiva 4 Pack"", they mean ""4 pieces of candy""!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!",4
475,"I bought this for cooking; from whipping egg whites to making my own baking powder, this cream of tartar is great.  I put some in a small jar in my cupboard for everyday use, the remainder I keep sealed tightly in the freezer.  It will last quite a long time, and buying it this way is exponentially less expensive than buying the small, over-priced jars in the grocery market.",4
480,"I started buying this cereal at the store after reading a recommendation about how much healthier sprouted grains are. Since it is rather expensive, I found that I could save a couple of dollars per box by buying it from Amazon. To my taste the cereal doesn't need any added sugar or anything to taste good and I like the consistency too. I also buy the almond flavor for variety.",4
483,"Thanks for the speedy shipping, got the products right on time. Very high quality Maple syrup, I will definitely buy Coombs brand Maple syrup from Amazon again.",4
484,"Tastes great, and it's a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives, even at our local supermarkets.  It's tough to find Grade A medium amber syrup in pints.  I'll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year.",4
485,The whole family loves these crackers. I like that they aren't very salty. My kids love them - we eat both the bunnies and goldfish and they've never mentioned that they can tell the difference.,4
488,"Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it's $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (I've found this to be true for several other items on this site.) I'm not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it's Amazon's responisbility to get to the bottom of this.",4
489,"Taste exactly like what you can get from store in Asia, beats all the US made products in the taste department.  Also great for making bread, not sure why not more US grocery stores carry them?!",4
495,These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size breakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast- too much trouble- but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door.,4
497,I was just introduced to these olives on a United flight this week. Probably the best tasting green olives I have ever had (I usually never eat green olives). I was so happy with them I purchased two snack pack boxes with the Olove packs on my return flight to share with my wife and kids. I'm thrilled I am able to purchase these on amazon and really suggest them to anyone looking for a great snack.,4
508,I know that you're taking a chance - after all they are flops but I think they're are overpriced.,4
511,"Good quality rice. Cooks well, and has a good overall flavor. No need to rinse first as with most Asian rice.",4
515,"Update: Was great at less than $6 with subscribe and save. Now, it's 16.99? Holy heck! No way!  One of the few crunchy cookies that taste homemade. So much better than Chips Ahoy, you'll completely forget about them. No yucky after taste like Chips Ahoy. Plenty of chocolate chips made with real chocolate. Gasp. I love the mini size. Perfect for putting a few in a condiment bowl and covering with milk. My secret midnight snack, every now and then, of course. Comes in a huge 40 oz. bag that will last my family of 6 for a month. Hence, I set this up for monthly delivery and at their subscribe rate, who can beat that?",4
516,Great healthy breakfast option for both kids and adults!  My 2 yr old son loves all flavors and the ingredients are much healthier than the commercial brands. :),4
520,"I found this snack to be tasty, healthy and satisfying! When I microwaved it, it was delicious.  Also very convenient for snacking on go.",4
526,We have a standing order for the beef sticks but always run out before hand and must order sooner. Love them.,4
531,"I have been a marzipan fanatic for over 55 years. While there are finer and fancier marzipans, in my opinion, for the money, this is a very nice, dependable product. I buy a 5 pound wedge every year, and make candy gifts for family and friends, and always get compliments and cheers. If you are a serious gourmet, you might not care for it, but for most people, for general use, it is quite nice.",4
533,"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!",4
535,"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!",4
537,"I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH?",4
541,Stocked up for work when it was on sale @ 1.73 per package. Good for emergencies but wouldn't buy it otherwise.,4
555,The product was and is fantastic.  The people who made this possible by helping me be able to order this were absolutely fantastic!!!!!,4
561,I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?,4
567,I order this tuna for my daugter who is in Afganastan every few months.  She loves it!!  They are limited what is available to eat and this usually makes her day.,4
570,I used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars??? how did it double out of nowhere??,4
582,"You just can't beat the taste of the original Dubble Bubble Gumballs! It really doesn't matter that the taste only last a minute or so, but that is why I bought the tub! The  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in A+++ condition! If your longing for the classic taste go for it! You will not be dissappointed!",4
593,My daughter really likes 5th Ave candy bars and they are hard to find in our area. Amazon  has them and they came quickly. Thanks for the good service.,4
594,"I had used these smaller jars of honey while on a trip in France a few years ago. They were in the hotels with the breakfasts. I don't use honey very often and the larger jars I purchase at the grocery store end up going to waste. These little jars are perfect for me. The flavor is not too intense and the size is perfect for my use. Plus, they bring back memories of a wonderful trip I took to a country where I grew up.",4
597,"I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the ""analog"" way), there are no volume problems.  It is simple to set up, being almost ""plug and play"".  You have to choose the input source.",4
600,The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted.,4
607,"This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product I'd order it again.  One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.  Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasn't truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st.",4
608,"Not my favorite, but for the price great product and It's handy, stores well and works well in coffee and other foods. I have added distilled water and used in my cereal. Straight is fine, but I am calorie conscious, so I prefer to add a little water. Organic Valley is the best, but for obvious reasons it cost more.",4
611,Have to hide these from my daughter.  Very good!!  Fast shipping and a good price.,4
615,Very good tasty.It is a great feeling to have it while i am watching the Crayon Shin-chan. And I think someone will share my feeling.,4
623,"This was a good purchase. Tastes good, pretty colors.  Seems to go a long way.  I used at a family reunion with a bunch of kids and they raved about it.  I hope what was not used holds up for next year.  I put it away so as not to be tempted.  Very happy.",4
625,"Best Energy bar ever...healthy, tasty, & less than 4 ingredients.  What could be better than that.  Great taste too.",4
628,"This power really gets me ready to workout without making me jittery. I do find that I can workout a little harder, longer without feeling exhausted. Love the taste, too.",4
630,"My wife found this coffee in a local grocery store and it is great tasting coffee. However, the local grocery quit carrying it and we were able to find it at Amazon. We started ordering and it has so far been a good experience.",4
643,"Not only is this a great deal, but the pineapple is delicious. Emerald does a great job, and each piece looks great and is nice and juicy.  I would just warn people to be aware of the sugar content, because there is 20g per serving.",4
644,"Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this!",4
645,"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?",4
646,Saves us a lot of money getting the refill packs than buying from the local store. we go through a lot of coffee and this is the only kind the boss likes so its a win-win.,4
648,"Slow As Molasses, Light and Mild, 11-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)by Slow As is a great product . I love the taste and smell of this Molasses.",4
651,"Tasty stuff - no complaints, other than I wish you could pick amongst the 4 selections, and perhaps avoid the ""Peppered"" flavored one, in favor of a different one.",4
654,taste just like reg animal crackers. i love them.. tried them from the grocery store first in the Mexican food section.. they are delicious,4
659,Very tasty crackers (especially for GF). Not many crackers in the box but if you're buying GF products you probably already know that. My whole family likes them. I bought a couple of cases last time to save money on shipping. FYI... they make a great substitute for bread crumbs in meatloaf and parmasean chicken.,4
668,forget cheetos! these are the best ever!  same price (or less if on sale) and better for you.  I could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it!,4
669,Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.,4
678,"SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW.",4
680,"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible.",4
682,"I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",4
689,I am a huge fan of Navitas brand products.  The quality of the Cacao is top notch and will be the brand I get from here on out.  Love it,4
700,Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed.,4
708,I have enjoyed using the maple flavor. It adds flavor to my diet that I would not have without it.,4
709,"I really enjoyed this product. It tastes good and is very close to the Russian or Iranian versions. Also, the service and quick delivery were an added bonus.  I would highly recommend this product.",4
713,My Son turned me on to this product and it is one of the best new products around. Just minutes makes a pitcher of tea that tastes like it has steeped for hours. I buy this product on subscribe and save which is cheaper than Walmart and keep it all year round. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful product and the convenience of having it delivered to my door.,4
714,"I was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee's birthday around these tablets. Placed an order well in advance, namely 3 weeks in advance.  After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.  Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.  This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled) they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem.",4
718,"I did not like this product at all, It made everything I used it to make taste the same- horrible.",4
722,This is a great tasting product with the best price I could find online or in the store.  This is my favorite flavor they offer.,4
730,"I have a delicious recipe for pumpkin muffins that I make again and again, and I am tired of spending too much money on the little supermarket jars of pumpkin pie spice.  The quality and taste of this product is just as good, for a fraction of the cost.",4
736,"I've never had Mallomars before.  I live in Wisconsin, and do not know if they make it all the way over here.  The only time I ever remember hearing the name before is in the Simpsons episode ""Hurricane Neddy"" when nice-guy Flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town.  Upon getting to the portly Police Chief Wiggum he says, ""The only case you've gotten to the bottom of was a CASE OF MALLOMARS!!!""  I assume by what I've read that they are a fall only type product, like the McRib.  I am also informed by the box that they are a New York kinda thing.  Regardless, I'm glad Vine gave me the chance to try them, because they are SO GOOD!!!  The crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s'mores like experience that truly satisfies.  An excellent snack.  Buy a box today.",4
738,"These were pretty tasty! They dont stick in your teeth like other fruit snacks which is a HUGE plus, but even better they're all natural and good for you. I'll buy them again for sure. Soon-- when this box runs out.",4
740,This has one of the best taste out there on the market.  I wish it would go on subscribe and save.,4
748,"This is a quality rock candy product and a very large amount for the price. I would deffinately buy this product again, if needed. Purchased as a gift and the person was more than thrilled",4
750,uhhh you can get one of these 10 ounce jars at the grocery store for 1.62  wtf.... The sauce is indeed the best  but 15 bucks really,4
756,fresh and good for you.  swift shipment.  highly recommended.  I've been using this product for over a year now.,4
763,"I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!  This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency...",4
767,These biscuits are really good! I bring them to school as a snack after practice or before lunch. I think they are a lot better than Nutri grain bars and Quaker Oats granola bars. I've also tried the apple flavored onesbut the blueberry ones definetely taste better. It's also really easy to find coupons for them on the internet: [...]/ or just Google Belvita coupons!,4
777,"This is very good maple syrup, but like most pure maple syrup, it is very expensive. My husband and I duped ourselves when purchasing this product. We did the math wrong, and though that we were paying about $25 for a half gallon rather than only 32 oz.  Man was I surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail!",4
778,This gum is quite good. I always chew gum in the gym and this will stay soft through a long workout and run.,4
783,"I tried this today and it was delicious!  It's not the texture you at first expect from eggplant, the flavors bridge that, and are really great.  Next time I will put this over rice. : )",4
786,"So I bought these when I saw a great deal on deals.woot.com about a coupon they had and I had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge.  These are tasty, although sometimes a little hard for my taste, and a little higher in calories than I would like in a snack (200 calories per bag)  But, it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut, and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer. The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.  Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste. Taste is great!",4
790,"I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in bricks to fill the box  -- this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!  These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.  I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!  They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.  I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make.",4
795,"Just ordered my 2nd bag from this company. Wish the bag wasn't so flimsy - I had to double bag it after opening- but other than that, excellent quality seeds and very prompt delivery.",4
806,"I was buying these at the pet store for $20 EACH, with this deal you get two for that price.  I ordered the largest size possible because I know my corgis like to chew the heck out of these.  They love these.  I've discovered they prefer the flat ones to the rounded type.  One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they ""argue"" over who gets the un-bent one!  If I hold the crooked one then they will chew it but they definitely like the flatter one best!  A very good value if your dogs are chewers!!!",4
808,For a time we could not get low carb pasta in our local store so I ordered this. It tastes great.,4
810,"I first found this product in the checkout lines at Austrian groceries. When I returned back to the US, I ordered this from Amazon to share with co-workers.  They are espresso-filled chocolates and are quite good.  I had to warn co-workers to put the entire thing in their mouth, because the espresso is liquid and will drip out if you bite.  My colleagues snapped them up quickly and we were energized for the rest of the day!  I had to hide them from my 6 year old because she liked them, too, and would climb anywhere to find them.  She already has enough energy.",4
821,THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT. DISSAPOINTED ONLY BY 4 CANS BEING DENTED. THEY WERE USABLE THOUGH. GREAT BUY COMPARED TO STORES!,4
825,"I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise.",4
828,"Good price even with the shipping costs. Chocolate arrived in perfect condition.  I use this chocolate for baking, it's excellent",4
830,"Skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here, I have seen this same bag for $5.89 on sale and not on sale for $7.99 at some big chain stores. the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just don't overspend to get a big bag (price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags)",4
831,This item comes securely packaged in three separate bags. The quality is a good value for the price.,4
836,I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.,4
837,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore.",4
838,"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!",4
841,"It seems like a lot, but they're great... especially if you have kids.  I know consumer waste isn't a good thing with individual packaging, etc., but I REALLY like these individually packaged snacks.  I usually buy a normal box at the store, but this has been so nice.  We always keep a bag handy for trips & snack time.  It's so convenient.",4
845,"I grew up in an Italian household and this was the only pasta my father would cook with. It was always available in the grocery store on the east coast when I lived there. I rarely see it where I live now in the mid west. When I do it is outrageously priced and a very limited selection.  I love this pasta and ordering it online is cheaper and easier than going out to the store. I also use subscribe and save which reduces the price even more and there is no shipping cost. It is a staple in our house.  The quality is excellent.  Cooked as directed the pasta holds its form and texture.  It doesn't become mushy or fall apart.  Even if you like your pasta soft and not ""Al Dente"" it holds in shape.",4
848,"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers.",4
849,"Yuck, these do not taste good and they are quite tough. Better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired.",4
854,"I liked the taste of these cookies and they reminded me of my childhood.  However, these are packaged different.  They are sealed in a plastic wrapper, not the wax type paper from a long time ago.  I am guessing that this keeps the graham crackers fresh tasting for a long time.  They were crispy and had a decent taste.  My only complaint was that several of the packages were damaged and the crackers were crumbs.",4
855,These cookies taste fantastic!  Even my picky children love them and ask for them every time we go to the grocery store!,4
856,Not the best rice ever but pretty good.  Have not seen it in any stores around my area so I would probably order this again.,4
857,"For some reason I can never find grape flavor in the stores, so this was a treat.  My bro in law says I eat like a 3 year old - so what, when it's this tasty!",4
861,"This tea is overpriced. At asian markets, retail is $6.95. Certainly, wholesale is drastically less. The price asked for here is appalling. It's the exact same tea and Foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas. The product is great, the seller? Doubtful.",4
865,"I grew up in Southern California, so I've had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. This mix is a great way to make these at home. I prepared a package of these for a friend of mine (who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake)....she's now addicted but can't find them at her local store. Thank goodness for Amazon!",4
867,I just paid $6.49 at my local Costco.  I don't know why they are so expensive here.  I love these little cookies.,4
868,"I'm not a beef stick/beef jerky eater.  These were bought for my son's school snack, however I have eaten a few and really like the beef flavor.",4
877,I have a hard time finding Half & Half in the stores locally and the Keurig site can be expensive. Very happy to find a supply!,4
885,The quality of this item is very poor. My 17 pound dog played with it a total of 5 minutes before the seams fell apart. Would not recommend it.  I returned this item the next day.,4
891,"I was shocked after tasting these to find that I like these better than other pretzels that are not gf, which is great due to having to switch to gf diet.  This makes a wonderful snack and the price is not that bad (even in the store, meijer's by me and whole foods both carry)",4
895,"I got this at Sams for $15 cheaper, shipped, but hopefully they adjust the price on here soon because I prefer using Amazon to order my goodies.",4
897,This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you.,4
899,"I was glad to find this for sale on Amazon.  We used to buy another brand of quinoa but we moved and can't find it in our area. Everyone in our family loves it.  Cooks just like rice, but has it's own flavor and very healthful.",4
901,I prefer the Saucettes but as they appear to be no longer available I tried these and have come to enjoy them just as much. These have a little better flavor but the Saucettes had a better texture. These taste much better than meat.,4
902,My husband loves this tea which isn't always available at the local grocer. The fact that the Amazon subscribe & save program brings it to our door at regular intervals just makes life easy.,4
909,"My 3-year old has been eating this soup since she was about 1 year old.  She absolutely loves it, and so do I. It's organic and very healthy (with lower sodium than just about any other canned soup on the market).",4
912,"We got them to add to Special K Red Berry cereal because sometime the end of the bag as fewer than the start.  But now we eat them by the hand full and add them to everything. My Daughter grabs the bag over other snack food, which makes me smile !",4
929,"I got this item as a little gift to my little sister who loves Japan. She, my brother, mother, and I tried it and it tasted great.",4
930,"Love these little packs of raisinets (hooray for portion control!) and when I saw them on amazon, I thought it was a great deal.  6 boxes of 6 packs of raisins!  I pay around $3 for a 6 pack at the grocery store, so this seemed like a really good bargain.  Boy, was I wrong.  I didn't get 6 boxes of the 6-packs, I got ONE six pack.  Which, according to amazon, has a retail price of 20 bucks!  That's insane.  Fortunately, a quick chat with customer service refunded my purchase, but I was still disappointed to find it was ONE pack and not 6.",4
938,"Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out.",4
942,I searched long and hard for this product and I was thrilled to learn that they had the exact ice bars that I was searching for. The customer service was the best and shipping was extremely fast!!! Thank you for making a hard to find product in the U.S accessible. And the costs were reasonable. I will definitely order again from this seller.,4
945,"Very tasty slightly smokey tea as appropriate to this type.  A little dusty (thus the 4 stars vs. 5), but did not seem to seriously effect flavor.  Would recommend to others for the price.  Organic is a plus.",4
947,"My daughter loves these dinners. There's no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so we're stuck with this one, but I don't mind at all. I think they're great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also don't understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you don't like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet. The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And that's at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much!",4
951,This McCann's Irish Oatmeal is an ideal breakfast.  It is easy to cook and taste good and heart healthy.  It's a good way to start a day.  The price is right and I would order again and agin.  Cecilia from Texas,4
958,What more can you say than it tastes great. Amazon had a good deal on this when I ordered it over a year ago.,4
966,"This macaroni and cheese is the only kind that both the adults and the kids in our family enjoy.  It has a slightly sharp cheddar flavor that makes it taste so much better than the ""processed cheese food"" types.  Our whole family swears by Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar and it is much cheaper buying them here than one at a time at the grocery store.",4
967,"We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. The pretzels would not have been bad for anything else, but there were way too many broken ones... we would have had to buy five more barrels. My only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven't received our refund!",4
973,"I'm trying to get more whole grains in my diet, and try as I might, I detest whole grain bread. These crackers are a wonderful substitute - crisp and pretty tasty as well! I love them with cheese. The only reason I knocked off a star is once you unwrap the package, you really need to put the whole thing in a Ziplock bag. There's no way to reseal so they stay fresh.",4
974,This is a healthy breakfast.  It hasn't changed in the over forty years I have been using it.  The taste is great and you can use them as crackers if you want.,4
975,This is great coffee at a fair price. Amazon has the best deals and super fast shipping.,4
981,"I've bought this product many times and this time (11/10) they are old or defective.  The bags don't puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  I've tried different time settings and in different microwaves.  I'm very dissapointed as this is a product I've been ordering for years.  Guess I'll have to call them and complain.",4
983,"This is the first review I have ever done, but I could not let this one go bye. This was the worst ever, save your money.",4
987,"I just received these as a birthday gift from my sister.  The strawberries were perfectly fresh, juicy, and sweet.  They were dipped perfectly and completely coated in delicious chocolate.  I was SO impressed!  She ordered them yesterday and I received them today.  They came nicely wrapped with birthday ribbon and packaged with a ""freezer"" or cold pak.  Again, I would highly recommend these as a delicious treat.  They are expensive, but well worth the SPECIAL treat for someone!",4
994,"This cereal is very tasty, and stays crunchy in milk. It makes a healthy snack as well. The whole family loves it.",4
1011,"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.  This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.  I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.  As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity, just be sure that you like it.",4
1013,"I was able to save about 20.00 by purchasing these through Amazon, as opposed to our local grocery store.  Since we go through a box a week, the savings can add up quickly.  Would definitely recommend.",4
1014,"These graham crackers are a lot better tasting than the organic graham crackers that I have tried. And compared to other brands (generic) I much prefer the crunchy sweetness of Honey Maid. The graham crackers taste so fresh and are the best for dunking in milk or tea. I love these as an alternative to cookies. Fortunately, the packaging ensures that the last graham cracker is as good and crispy as the first one. The portable and palatable treats are great for kids or anyone on the go (and for making perfectly shaped s'mores).",4
1025,"For some reason our local stores stopped stocking this product, my wife and I love the taste.  We used Amonzon.com to provide it.  Excellent TASTE!",4
1035,WE RUN A CATERING AND EVENTS COMPANY AND USE THESE MOSTY FOR CHILDRENS PARTIES...THEY ARE EASY TO SERVE AND THE CHILDREN LOVE THE BOYARDEE PRODUCTS. WE CANT GET THEM FROM ANY SUPPLIER FOR WHAT AMAZON SELLS THEM FOR IN THE SUBSCRIBE&SAVE PROGRAM...AND THEY TASTE GOOD AS WELL.,4
1040,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25.  Nespresso makes GREAT machines and GREAT coffee pods. These pod offers on Amazon however are mostly from third party vendors. They prey on people who don't know better, charging you 2x the price of ordering the pods directly from Nespresso. I have been ordering through Nespresso's website for a couple of years now and their shipping times are always fast and reliable. I buy many things through Amazon, but not Nespresso pods.",4
1046,Love Dreamfields Pasta.  Can't get the lasagna noodles where I live so I was so happy to find them at Amazon. Delivery was quick.  The only thing is the noodles got broken in shipment which was a dissappointment.,4
1049,quality gum ball machine. I am very happy with it. solid glass and classic look. It is a christmas gift for my daughter and a great way to show her how to save money. plus she gets a little reward.,4
1051,"I love pineapple juice and drink it every day. Fresh is the best, but this is surprisingly good. I usually keep some on hand for convenience. It is so much better tasting than the stuff from concentrate. The price on Amazon is kind of high though. I find it's cheaper just to stock up at our local grocer.",4
1054,"I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.  It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!",4
1056,"I received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in. This isn't very surprising due to the type of plastic it's packaged in -the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture- but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully. Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it! That's just outrageous. Very very dissatisfied. I have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from Wilton  Wilton Sugar Pearls, White, 5 Oz  which incidentally, are less than half the price.  I should say, that generally my experience with Amazon and returns has been excellent. The few dragees left in the package were beautiful, uniform in shape and tasty. I view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product/its packaging. However it could have been handled better.",4
1057,"The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good.",4
1060,"These quaker cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run.",4
1062,Very tasty snack.  I have re-ordered this item twice already.  Too bad the price increased $4.00 since my last order though.,4
1065,"I bought this Hazelnut Paste (Nocciola Spread) at a local shop in Palm Cost, Florida. The taste is excellent and healthier than Nutella.",4
1070,I like that these are all individually packages. They are great to snack on or share with other. Great flavors!,4
1074,"More of a cross between a cracker and a cookie. I love these! They have a very distinct flavor that both my wife and I enjoy, as well as the kids. Trust me, to find a snack that everyone likes in our family is no small task! But we are very happy with the Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, and look forward to trying other flavors.",4
1080,"Well, ""licorice"" is a stretch, but this is like most of the Newman products -- tasty and good quality. Whether YOU like the taste is, of course up to you, but I did.",4
1082,"My son (age 5) has food allergies (wheat, soy, dairy, peanut).  So he knows when he sees ""Enjoy Life"" on the package, he can actually have it!  And it's great for him to have options w/ different flavor cookies.  It makes it easier for me when I have to pack his lunch for school to give him something different each day.  The only thing I would love to have on the subscribe and save program is the ability to mix and match products.  But the product itself is great.  My son says they have a little bit of a bite to them, but that is how ginger cookies are.  He compares these to the Pamela's ginger snaps.  He likes both.  But sometimes he likes to have the ""soft"" ginger cookies...which is the Enjoy Life type.",4
1086,"The reason why I bought this because it's using HALAL beef. The taste is great, a little sweet and not to chewy. We love it and will order more later. Will recommend to my friends!",4
1088,"I ordered this from Amazon and they were pure liquid. Like water. I did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. Amazon customer service, however, was awesome and gave me a full refund",4
1091,"I used the icicle for about two hours. After taking a break, I plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. I did everything I could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. Nothing. In the process of a return. =/ It would've been perfect if it just worked.",4
1096,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.  A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.  All in all, this is still a decent option for days when you know you're going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would-be fridge thieves.",4
1100,"These breadsticks were wonderful with hummus and spinach dip. Wonderfully light and crisp with just a hint of herbs. I'll also add addicting! I rated it only a 4 star because the shipping was careless. Half the boxes contained broken breadsticks and I really wanted to serve them upright. Hopefully, Amazon will take note and ship with padding next time.",4
1103,"These are really tasty, and not too sweet. We ordered another box. Great in oatmeal. They are somewhat oily, but this is not a problem, just a surprise compared to something like raisins.",4
1108,"Much cheaper than buying them at our local store, and a great 100 cal snack. Good taste, so no complaints.",4
1109,"Iv been eating fruit leather for over 10 years.  This is my favorite flavor.  Buying in bulk is the way to go, and they are very reasonable here.",4
1111,I am looking at a can of NIDO (12.6 ounces; 360 grams) for which I paid $3.54 plus sales tax yesterday at WalMart. The one-star rating is for your creative pricing; not the product. I'd give the product 5 stars.,4
1114,This is a very good rice and I will be ordering more.  Good flavor and it is always a surprise at a dinner party.,4
1121,This item was purchased as a gift and my step-dad really enjoyed them. The package was large and substantial so it really felt like he was getting a good gift. I was pleased with the company and had a smooth transaction. I would purchase from again!,4
1123,"purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged. customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it.",4
1125,"Liquid Aminos have been a staple in my food seasonings for a long time. I buy in bulk on Amazon, since its a much better deal and the bottles are so much bigger. I will never use regular soy again, since this literally tastes the exact same, yet is SO much better for you. I am so glad to have found this product and even more glad that Amazon sells it in bulk.",4
1138,THIS ITEM IS GREAT.  100% FRUIT AND STILL GREAT TASTING.  MY KID LOVES THESE THINGS.  HE IS A LOVER OF FRUIT SNACKS AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS HEALTHY AND TASTEFUL AND I'VE FOUND IT.,4
1139,"Great company, when item came in stock they let me know, I ordered it and it came quickly. Definately a company to buy from!",4
1146,"I've been eating carnation instant breakfast for a few years now and this is about as a good a price as I've found (I've found it cheaper when on sale at a local store but those sales are rare). I use two cups of milk instead of the instructed one, so the flavor is diluted a bit, but still good.",4
1148,"These do taste better than the cheap brands like Maruchuan, and you get a slightly larger (3.5oz block), but these are WAY more expensive.  I've seen them in local Wal-Marts for a slightly lower price.  Overall they do have a good flavor, not too salty or mushy.",4
1149,"This has recently become my staple breakfast cereal. After trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals, I decided to find one that fits my needs. I am a regular at the gym so I have to watch what I eat. This one is not only high in protein and fiber, but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber. It can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition. The price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores.",4
1150,"This is the only rice cereal we use for my son. He has had bad acid reflux and of course needs cereal in every bottle so we go through a good bit. After comparing proces, this is the cheapest we have found. Though only pennies in difference, you cant beat the fact that it is free shipping and comes straight to your door.",4
1154,I have trouble finding anything like these in the stores so I was happy to find them here!  They taste great and are a very good bargain.,4
1157,"I got the same product at my local grocery store for $9.99. Much cheaper - what's going on Amazon? You aren't even offering a bulk price. Great product, my dogs love them too, but can be found much cheaper elsewhere.",4
1160,"I really love this stuff!  I just discovered this from one of those cooking shows on TV and wanted to try it.  It is difficult to find Farro in regular grocery store, and not everyone has an Italian grocery store close to them. It's just really convenient to order from Amazon with free shipping. It arrived very quickly.",4
1165,Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!,4
1171,"I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible",4
1177,i was a little bit uneasy at ordering a plant online. but bonsaiboy sent this beautiful cherry tree promptly and it arrived in beautiful condition. i will definitely recommend him again.,4
1183,"I ordered this cereal from Amazon's: Subscribe and Save. The Buckwheat cereal arrived within four days, arriving fresh. Super taste, with all natural organic ingredients.  I'll continue with the Subscribe and Save to be certain I have a monthly supply coming.",4
1184,"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked.",4
1187,"Great taste, Ive tried many types of protein, this one was by far the best Ive ever had.",4
1194,Bought a case to see what it was about.  I am a night owl which effects my day-to-day performance and father-related tasks.  After a can I do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier.,4
1195,"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product. However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging.",4
1196,"This seller consistently provides high quality edibles for very reasonable prices, and this Fleur de Sel is no exception.  Extremely tasty, well packaged, and timely delivery.",4
1197,"With the exception of home-made, these are my favorite egg noodles. They always cook up just right -- firm and tasty. I got them on an Amazon Warehouse deal so the price was better than getting them at a warehouse club (and far better than the grocery store). These are the medium ones which are pretty narrow in size. Good for adding to soups, casseroles, or just tossing with some butter and veggies.  Came well packed with no discernable breakage in the packages.",4
1200,"Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 /box coupon. Its too high here",4
1201,"OMG!THIS IS A RIP-OFF!I LIVE IN TEXAS WHERE YOU CAN BUY A 12-PACK OF FAYGO FOR UNDER 4 BUCKS.  THIS IS REALLY GOOD SODA. THE PRODUCT ITSELF, IS GREAT BUT WAY 2 OVERPRICED. I AM DISAPPOINTED.",4
1207,I ordered 8 cans of Earth's Best Organic formula and I got them in time as scheduled. We have been using it since my daughter was 2 weeks old. She is 10 month old now and she loves it. It is cheaper to order it online then buy it from babiesrus.,4
1220,"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.  Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.  Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!",4
1221,"I ordered this from another website and my newly diagnosed to need to be Gluten Free 16 year old son LOVED it. When returning to the other site to no longer find it there, I returned to my old friend Amazon.com. I am impressed with all the GF products that I can get on here....and even more excited that I can use the Subscribe and Save option to have a continuous supply of mac n cheese always in our house. Thanks.",4
1227,"I bought these berries as I needed to add something to my cart for super saver shipping.  I was planning to get goji berries from Whole Foods in bulk, the cheapest source by me for organic gojis in town.  They run about $18 a pound there.  I got them on sale here for $11-12.  I liked the ones from Whole Foods, but these are even better!  They are fresher, probably since they are put reasonably quickly into the bags and sealed.  The other ones taste like some sort of gummy fruit rolll-up type treat (good), but these actually taste like a fruit.  You should buy some.  The only problem is that I eat them too quickly, they should be called wolf-them-down-berry.",4
1231,"These are some very tasty and sweet crackers.  They are a bit hard, not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store.  They are very tasty and and make a great snack.  I have not had a chance to make smoores with them, but I suspect they will be great for that too.  They are well formed and don't crumble apart easily so they are very versatile.",4
1243,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box.",4
1244,"There are very few unsalted snacks available for those with salt related high blood pressure.  My mother looks forward to receiving her monthly supply of cashews.  Always fresh, always tasty and always safe for her to eat.",4
1258,Mat&eacute; is an awesome drink and Rosamonte makes an affordable and good tasting product. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.,4
1261,"I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:  (1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.  (2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.  (3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.  (4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.  (5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99.",4
1262,If you like spicy...then these are the snack crackers for you. So hard to find ANYWHERE ELSE...a really good price on here!,4

1272,"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone. I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture. This company has superb customer service!",4
1273,"If you like apricots or peaches this is the energy bar for you.It is completely natural, tasty, not overtly sweet and the minis are a prefect dessert or snack size.Buying it on Amazon is the best deal I found for these especially with the subscribe and save option. In grocery stores you are paying close to $22 for the same box.",4
1274,This is a good product but I can't believe such a high price usally Amazon is close on prices but you can buy these at Sam's club for $7.68.,4
1276,"Packaged well. Healthy on arrival and have held up a month later. KL Design provided great support. Shipped quickly. Great communication and when they realized a mistake was made for the cost of shipping, KL corrected the issue before I even realized there was a mistake. I would definitely buy from them again.",4
1283,"I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family.",4
1297,Very good maple syrup!  I use it daily in place of sugar.  The no-drip spout is very nice.,4
1298,"This dried pineapple is of very good quality. The pineapple pieces are of a good size and moist. My 6 year old daughter loves them,and requests them for her school snack pack.",4
1302,"too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two).",4
1311,"These are just too tasty. Seriously, they need to come in a big box, like FiddleFaddle. I could munch on these all day long. I don't get to, as my wife and kids keep cleaning out my supplies before I can get to them. Damn you, 8-5PM job!!!",4
1316,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased with the natural ingredients and no calories.,4
1317,"Unsaid in the description of this item is the fact that you receive only one box for $10.95. The same item can be purchased Directly from Dreamfields for only $2.99, which probably explains why this ad does not reveal the number of boxes in an order.",4
1328,"We have enjoyed Eight O'Clock 50/50 coffee for several years. I keep an eye on the price at the 2 local grocery stores and try to stock up when it goes on sale, which is not often. Amazon has been putting the whole beans on sale rather regularly and the price is far better than the grocery store. The beans store well in the freezer. It's delivered right to your door, so what's not to love about that?",4
1337,I use this syrup on pancakes and to make homemade granola. It is great tasting with lots of maple flavor. I love the spill resistant spout. Good value instead of going to the grocery store for pure maple syrup.,4
1338,"I was super excited to find this online for a better price than my grocery store.  I've never used spelt flour before, but I made cookies with it and I liked them.",4
1346,"People watch out if you are buying this product online. I've ordered 12 bottles of the O.N.E, I was expecting this to be same as what I bought from store but this seller disappointed me, The bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what I expected, I'm sure that this seller/ the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal. I've wasted my money on this product, I'll never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it.  my rating for this product is 0/5.  In short, Seal broken, Diluted and Not comparable with the one that I bought from store.",4
1353,The crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and I absolutely love'em. We will definitely get more once we run out!,4

1358,"YES, these are wonderful and healthy cookies, but this is a rare bad deal from Amazon (really DAB Nutrition)- they are charging about $25 (including shipping).  In less than a minute of web searching I found the same quantity for about $15 shipped.  Enjoy the cookies, but buy from someone else until the price comes down.",4
1359,"Love this dip, my husband is nuts over it, has been eating it quite often since receiving the package.  All Wise products have been fantastic.",4
1367,They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.,4

1378,"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first.",4
1388,"I bought keenan Farms Pistachios once earlier. That batch appeared to alright.This time around the product is not upto mark at all. I have bought Pistachios from local stores also, which are far better and cheaper than this. I have opened only one bag from the 3 that I have received. If any one from Keenam farms is reading this I can return these to them so that they can see what is in the bags sent to me.",4

1405,"It's moist.  It is filled with all the things I love in fruitcake (candied cherries, dates, and LOTS of pecans) and none of the stuff I don't like. Best of all, it's available year round!

So, just hoping by chance Amazon would have this item, I scroll through and bingo.  The projected delivery date was not going to arrive in time for Thanksgiving so I was told.  But, it arrived within two business days.  My family was very delighted to say the least.",4
1421,We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often. This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient. Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.,4
1424,"Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed",4
1430,I received this gift box as a gift and completely overlooked all the other candy in my house. I am going through a total eighties phase right now and this retro candy was perfect. I don't know what else to say except that I love this candy gift box.,4
1431,"I've never ordered canned goods online before this so I was nervous. Boy, what a great experience! I don't have access to a Asian market where I am and I really wanted to make masaman rather than order take out. I followed the recipe on the can, reducing it by half as was recommended in one of the reviews. It was really flavorful and a tad spicy, I might even try a quarter of the amount next time. So happy that this worked out!",4
1434,I orderd a case when the last grocery store I knew about quit carrying the product.  It is a very good olive spread.  Makes a very tasty and reasonable calorie snack.  However two of the six jars had leaked and the lids were not sucked in.  I called the company and they credited my account immediately.  They get an A for customer service.,4
1435,"I absolutely love this product and most of the flavors.  It is not sold in stores by me any longer, so was delighted to find it here.  Much better than the same type of drink sold by the other big name company's.",4
1439,"Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.  I was excited about these, they looked like a ""grown up graham cracker"".  First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific. I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I'd have just got a second bag of  Hi I'm Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce . Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste.",4
1442,My order was hassle free and processed swiftly. The packaging was well done and the delivery was right on the money. Definintly recommend buying your Slim Jims here!,4
1448,"I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because ""rain forest"" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey.",4
1449,"This is simply a mix of brown sugar and Splenda, I am sure it would be cheaper to make your own",4
1456,"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes.",4
1463,"I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.",4
1464,Received my order today. I was very pleased with the fast shipping. A++ 5oz dried is a lot. I ordered 2 which will last me a longgggggggg time.,4
1468,"Ordered this because of some minor stomach issues. Certainly, hasn't hurt, but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim, but only time will tell. A few things...this honey tastes great, just about like regular honey. So don't be afraid to order it thinking you can't handle the taste. It has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar, or on toast. Bottom line, probably more expensive than regular honey, but if you have some digestive issues, worth trying, as it is a good tasting product.",4
1477,I did not expect this to taste very good.  I was surprised that it was great.  I will be ordering this item in the future. It also arrived very quickly.,4
1478,"Some of the cinnamon sticks have patches of mold. Other sticks smell like smoke, not cinnamon.  Previous orders were okay, but this batch will be my last purchase of this brand.  Grocery stores sometimes pull questionable products from the shelves until quality issues are resolved with the supplier. There needs to be an equivalent online response.",4
1479,wasn't expecting much from the product however it delivered a lot better taste than other products of this type that I have tried,4
1482,These are better quality beans than you find in most grocery stores.  This is my second shipment and noticed this time the cans were packaged better.  I didn't have any cans that were dented.  The price is better than the grocery stores too.,4
1483,"I was pleased with the ingredients in these bars. I thought that there could have been a slightly bolder fruit flavor. The peanuts were plentiful, and that was a plus for me. Overall, I would rate them a good buy, and would definitely consider purchasing them.",4
1484,"I stumbled upon these cookies while shopping at Target and instantly fell in love with their amazing chocolate taste, not to mention their healthy ingredients. I was so disappointed to find that Amazon does not carry these and they have to be bought through another seller. If they were on Subscribe and Save I can promise you I'd be the first to set up a monthly order!! Come on Amazon-give these delicious cookies a chance!!",4
1490,I ordered these as a gift in June. They tasted great! They did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but I was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me.  The strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them.  I would recommend them highly,4
1492,Placed my order and shipping was fast.  The product arrived in great condition and they tasted wonderful. I recommend them to other family members who also purchased them.  After I finish my review I'm going to buy more. Great taste and great value.,4
1502,"These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.",4
1503,We've tried alot of the Josef products... they're all absolutely delicious.  Glad to see Amazon is offering them as they can be hard to find.  Their cookies fit the bill for those with allergies to multiple ingredients -- but you'd never know they were allergy friendly from the taste.  They're worth the price.  (I can serve them to guests -- kids and adults alike -- and they never know the difference!),4
1504,"Nature's Path makes some excellent cereals, and this is definitely one of them. I really enjoy it because it has great flavor, a good crunch, and is a very healthy food. In fact, this is my favorite cereal-- hands down.  I totally recommend buying the pack of 6-- a penny saved is a penny earned. Besides, it's not like the cereal is going to go bad; it'll keep for months until you break the seal.",4
1513,These are really tasty and make a great high protein snack.  I order them regularly and keep them in my desk drawer.  They are really filling and taste great.,4
1515,"I tried these for my two sons since they need to bring their own snacks to school every day and needed something made in a facility without peanuts.  They are healthy and not too high in sugar.  My sons think they taste ok, but not great.",4
1522,I love these gummy bears but I can buy the same bag 6 lb bag for $5.96 at SamsClub.  Thus the Amazon price is a rip off.  I wish Amazon would work to provide us the lowest prices.,4
1523,"Thought I'd take a chance on this, as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades (light amber is best).  Price is beautiful -- grocery store charged as much for two 8-ounce bottles as this whole quart.  Shipping time was amazing -- super saver in 1.5 days -- and yum!  Reminded me that it's been years since I bought a 3-pound box of maple sugar candy...  Time to search again... &lt;grin> Forgor to mention -- definitely grade ""A"" Fancy -- not grade ""B"" (the cooking grade).  Hidden Springs Maple Vermont Maple Syrup, 1 Quart - Fancy Grade - Light Amber",4
1524,"It's a great product. I got some while I was in England and brought some home to share with my family. My children ate the entire box at no time. Very tasty, crunchy... Too bad it's so expensive to buy it here in the U.S.!",4
1525,I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.,4
1529,"I've never needed to use these for energy as I never feel drained. But my brother recommended them, saying he takes one before and every half hour of his runs. I still haven't noticed a difference but when I start running over 14miles maybe I'll need it.",4
1537,This is a high quality tea.  You can instantly tell the difference between this Earl Grey and the other more commons ones you find in the grocery store.  They are of such quality you can steep twice for two cups instead of one.,4
1539,I like buying these in bulk as it they are easier to store in the box. Good product. Usually beats the price at my local stores.,4
1542,"I saw that 1 star rating and thought ""there's no way the folks at Buffalo Bills could produce a beef stick rated one out of five."" I bought them because of that one star and I was right, its a 5 star snack just like everything else they sell. It is much better than any common Slim Jim or Jack Links beef stick.",4
1549,"This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  It's a yucky product.",4
1560,One of my favorites.....hopefully this continues at a reasonable price. Each k-cup brews perfectly. Well pleased.Will continue to order as long as it is a suscribe and save item.,4
1563,"For being a natural and relatively healthy food item, I'm impressed by how good these crackers actually taste!  They're not as sweet as a standard graham cracker, but again, very good for what they are.  I top them with natural peanut butter and eat them with a glass of milk, yum!",4
1566,"This newton product is a good adaptation of a cracker. The fruit is in the product but, it is thin and chewy! My 3 year old enjoyed it also.I would highly recommend it for adults, youth, and children. The idea of making this type of change shows creativity and ingenuity with such a wonderful brand.",4
1568,My parents were very satisfied with the steak and I was happy with the delivery time.,4
1571,"Very good product, the $4.00 increase did less to change my subscription. I love this product and will continue buying in future.",4
1573,"Fantastic, juicy and tender! Everything was great...is great (there is only the 2 of us) but next time I may even order with the desserts included.",4
1574,"A neat package, cheap, of very tasty, lichee flavored gummy candy. Each piece of candy packed on it's own guarantees the freshness. Yummy.",4
1575,I find these are excellent quality almonds at a resonable price. They are really going fast---going to have to order more soon.,4
1577,Arrives $15.06 postage due in a used Friendly 's box. UNFRIENDLY don't you think? Worst service ever!!!!!_Totally unfriendly! !!!aweful aweful aweful service!,4
1581,"This steak rub is awesome. We have tried many different ones and came across this one in a grocery store. It quickly became our favorite. After that, we couldn't find it in any local stores so having the 6 pack is great.",4
1583,"I bought this a few weeks ago and really like this product. This is my first time buying this product, and I find that it easy to cook (in a rice cooker!) and has a really nice chewy texture. The flavor is nutty and good too. If you like brown rice and/or wild rice, I think you will like this. The only downside for me is the price. I can buy a 20 lb (yes, that's right) bag of good white rice at an Asian market for $15.",4
1585,"The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.  What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.  What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.  Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little more bang for your buck and have more flavor.",4
1588,These were delicious!  I would definitely recommend this for a snack or a wedding!  This was a great purchase for my husband and me.,4
1602,"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go.",4
1606,"Have been using RiceSelect Royal Blend for years as the healthier, tastier alternative to plain brown rice and plain white rice. After my local supermarket stopped carrying it, I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com -- at a lower price than in the supermarket.",4
1607,I bought these for a bridal shower for gift bags.  I received the item quickly and the chocolate was perfectly wrapped.  Another review noted that some of the wrappers were broken.  I only had maybe 1 where I had to fix the wrapper.  I thought they looked great.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I do feel as though it's overpriced for what you get.,4
1614,"This is great candy, smooth and flavorful with a great 'mouth"" as the TV chefs like to say.  However-- six bucks for ten pieces of hard candy?  The dollar store stocks this pretty regularly. Same brand, same size-- one dollar.",4
1619,"These sandwhich crackers are very good. The whole family loves them, and they are healthy compared to what is in the store.",4
1621,"I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another ""name brand"" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.  I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)  UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box - no dents or dings anywhere!",4
1622,"As other's have mentioned, this is available in other stores for much cheaper so I recommend to shop around before buying on Amazon.  When it comes to the actual product, I highly recommend buying this if you own a Keurig. You are able to discretly hide so many of the Keurig cups. The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.  This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes. The material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your Keurig doesn't move at all.  Highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from BBB or Amazon!",4
1623,"Great nutty flavor and delightful texture, but what puts it over the top is the great price with the Amazon ""Subscribe and Save"" program. Buy it.",4
1631,Best quality oil I've encountered.  I was impressed with the packaging for shipping.  Nice job.,4
1633,"Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Honey Cluster with either the Carmel or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load.

Thanks and have a healthy day!!!",4

These are a good cookie, but in no way are they worth $19 a box.  Just another rip-off.  There is even a much cheaper alternative right here on Amazon.  Keep looking. You'll find a much better deal than from this guy.",4
1651,"The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount.",4
1653,"I love Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps.  They're delicious, healthy, and have protein.  They're a great snack, and I keep some in my car when I get hungry in the afternoon.  They're cheaper to buy in bulk online, because in the store you pay over a dollar per bag.",4
1658,"The price for these K-Cups is great. They are so costly in the store, so this is a great way to buy in bulk.",4
1659,"I asked my brother, who is a chef, how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone. His comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift. He looked at the idea of buying something similar from Hickory Farm in the Mall where he lives since Mother's Day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the Mall. I had thought Hickory Farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that Wisconsinmade, this company whose product I am reviewing, did a far better job in quality and produce. I think that says it. For those who see only volume and not quality, stay with the grocery store, it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria.  I will note that I bought a couple of these products from this company and I have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality.  Quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well.",4
1665,I guess everyone's taste buds are different.  This product didn't work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-(,4
1666,I love this cereal i eat it every morning adding maple syrup makes even more satisfying,4
1669,"Obviously ""taste"" is subjective. I wanted to add my opinion and 5 stars to the tally to this item because I believe it is worth it.",4
1673,"This is great for graham cracker crust.  I made a cheesecake, and my gluten eating husband raved about it!  Can't wait to make another pie with it.",4
1687,There was no seal of any kind on jar. Cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. Would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went.,4
1688,My daughter teaches kindergarten and I help her and the other 6 kindergarten 120 kids do gingerbread houses at Xmas.  Every year we have to buy the small tubes since M&m do does not sell the bags locally.  These 6 bags are much cheaper and we will have left overs for other projects.,4

1695,This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.,4
1701,"Sorry for the long delay, I really do not like to write negative comments, but this was delivered to my Mother-in-law, stale and bad.  She threw it out.",4
1706,"this is the most versatile, tasty, nutritious product ive come to encounter. can be used as cereal, a snack, etc. delicious and nutritious.",4
1709,"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase.",4
1714,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.  I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least.",4
1722,"I've been ordering dried cherries by mail for several years now, from another source. These cherries are just as good as my previous source, at a better price, thanks to Amazon Prime.",4
1733,My daughter tells me these are the best tasting message hearts.  I ordered these after Valentine's Day just because she likes them so much.,4
1735,"Excellent low-carb option for people on low-carb diets. Also a very tasty product even if you are not... I deep fried a few of them just to see how it worked and they were even better (and definitely much worse for me health wise!). Overall, extremely well made and high quality product!",4
1736,"I ordered the 35 pack.  Maybe I just got lucky but I had an excellent variety!  I have 19 different kinds, doubles of the majority.  With one flavor I got 3. There were probably 7 decafs.  They were thrown into the box, but none were damaged.  Overall, I'm happy and I'll probably order again.",4
1739,"I have loved ultra thin pretzel sticks since Mr. Salty used to sell them.  Then for decades I never saw an other ultra thin pretzel sticks and didn't even know if any were available anywhere.  Then I saw them at a local department store and was ecstatic.  But then, after going twice, they discontinued them - these are the ones that were at the department store.  I was disappointed but decided to give Amazon.com a shot and see if I could find them here.  And I did!  They even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month, 3 months, or 6 months and the price for a case is reasonable (especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free - just buying a case costs WAY too much with shipping).  I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.  And I found that having a case on hand is nice and so we're getting them every 6 months - that gives us time to eat what we want, share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them.  It's great - I highly recommend these - especially if you love ultra-thin pretzel sticks like I do.",4
1741,"These lollipops are not as pictured. They came in assorted colors, some really drab, not the rainbow brights shown in the picture. They are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap. I need them for a birthday party and I was really disappointed when I received them.",4
1745,"So far, the best decaf coffee I have tasted. Just leaves me wondering why no local grocery store carries it.",4
1747,this is a great price and the delivery was super fast i first found these in yosemite at a much higher price & limeted QTY.,4
1750,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.,4
1753,"After being pleased with my first order of these rawhides, I set up a recurring order for them. We received a box last week and were disappointed to find that the quality of these bones is not the same as the first order. The first order of bones contained rawhides that were tightly-rolled and long-lasting, but these have inner layers that are brittle and easily broken. One of our dogs actually cut her mouth or gums on the brittle shards--we didn't realize it until we saw blood on the bone itself. Amazon is refunding the purchase price. I may try one more time with this brand. If anyone has found a consistent quality brand at this kind of price, please let us know. Maybe my budget is the problem...",4
1754,"The product description is very accurate.  I received my item in a timely manner and the items were well packaged and still frozen.  The portions are large and are very easy to prepare in the oven.  And, of course, the Chicken Cordon Bleu has a wonderful, savory taste that isn't skimpy on either the ham or cheese.  If I could rate 4.5 stars I would, simply due to price. However, don't let price stop you from ordering....these are delicious.",4
1762,Excellent breakfast alternative and meets low sugar expectation.  Not sure why this product is not widely available in stores.,4
1764,This is as good as you can get in a commercial product.  If you like a rich caponata you'll like this product.,4
1771,"These are very good, premium graham crackers.  Delicious.  What else can I say? It is as good as a graham cracker can get, which is to say ... good, but not that great.  They are a bit pricey, about 30% more than a regular graham cracker ... is it worth it?  Who knows?  How much do you LOVE graham crackers?  If you love graham crackers, or have lots of money to burn, sure - go for it.",4
1775,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.",4
1782,Enjoy using this product in all my cooking most of all I enjoy ordering from Amazon- they have such great customer service.,4
1797,"The product was delicious and arrived in a timely fashion.  However, I did see them cheaper at one of those wholesale stores.",4
1798,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon.",4
1800,"I'm glad I bought these before the price rose from $14.78 to $24.82.  They're good, but not worthy of such a large price hike. If the cost returns to a reasonable value I'll consider buying them again.",4
1801,"I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a ""good"" steak at home. The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife. The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time. They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.  Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks. If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.  Will never buy again.",4
1807,I order this because of the other reviews.  It is really good.  Went to their website to get more receipes.,4
1816,"Overall, the product is fantastic and the coffee is great! I am giving a review of 4 stars only because Amazon's advertising is misleading, it does not come in the advertised box, as someone else indicated, it's an unmarked box with 3 smaller bags on the inside.  It is not a ""plastic K kup"", the product that you receive is what is pictured, with a filter type bottom. It does fit in your Keurig and brews just fine.  I love the aroma and the taste of this coffee, reminded my husband and I of espresso we had in Siily, Italy a few years ago.",4
1817,"Good overall oil for salads, cooking, etc., we have benn buying it from on Amazon for a couple of years now and are on auto ordering which is even a little cheaper making it a GREAT deal",4
1819,"It's my regular cereal now. Cinnamon is a strong spice so yes it dominates. Too sweet, based on the amount of carbs in a serving its higher than some by two or three grams but with the amount of fiber including four grams of soluble, the net carbs is reduced. Only knock here I wish it was available through the auto delivery service as this price appears to be way too high, its about $4.50 in the local store for one box.",4
1822,"Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.  That's how disgusting this bar is.  I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.  This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.  Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.  ""Enjoy Life"" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.",4
1823,"I am very fond of this coffee, and I won't accept substitutes for it. Several of my local stores have substituted another brand. I just order it on-line when I cannot get it in a store. HOWEVER, Amazon's price is too high. It's $4 a jar in local stores.",4
1824,"i found this product doing a search for ""edible gold leaf."" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked ""NOT to be consumed"" and ""for decorative use only."" so this is a misleading product.",4
1832,"How do you expect me to buy yhis product for this price? Keurig sells the same item for only $10.75, less than half the asking price here....",4
1834,Would not recommend this product to anyone because it had chemical taste which my guests complained about when I served on a buffet type dinner. I was so embarrassed!,4

1839,"Excellent product! Healthy and delicious, this product contains only high quality ingredients, no preservatives or refined refined food items.  You can keep them in your office when you are pressed for time and hungry. Mine came with a 2 year shelf life and also has a ""spork"" which is a handy feature.",4

1859,"This item is very tasty. It actually tastes better than bouillon. When I made pilaf using this chicken base it tasted exactly the way it tastes when I use homemade chicken base. Lots of flavors, kosher/halal, 100% natural product with number one ingredient being chicken with natural juices and reasonable price. What else to expect from a jar of chicken base.",4
1861,way overpriced Jewel has this for $2.79 same bag size. and look at the overpriced shipping cost.,4
1865,"Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee, it's much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Don't waste your money.",4
1871,"I like this hot cocoa mix a lot.  The taste is better than what you usually get at the office or grocery store, which shouldn't come as a surprise for a Ghirardelli product.  It's a bit expensive, but it's worth it in my view.",4
1875,"I was first introduced to these little gems at Sam's Club, but they no longer carry them, so I turned to Amazon and found a  great price on a product I hope to keep using for years.  It is the first (and only) individual serving drink mix diet tea I have found that is sweetened with Splenda - I don't do aspartame.  Delicious, too!",4
1876,"I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.  They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients.",4
1881,"I've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",4
1882,"If you like instant this is a good deal.  I priced it at Cub, a local grocery store, and the unit price was about two bucks less.  This tastes fine.  It tastes like instant coffee.",4
1887,Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.,4
1892,This is my favorite snack bar. The price is about the same as the sale prices I find at the supermarket on a per unit basis.,4
1897,"The taste reminds me of maple syrup.  It's very tasty when used in cereal or on pancakes, but it's also a perfect sweetener for my tea, and it doesn't change the flavor of my tea when I use it.  I don't use honey, nor do I like the taste, and this does not taste anything like honey to me.",4
1911,PROS_______THIS CEREAL IS GREAT TASTING.....fills you up new box color NOT LIKE IN THE PICTURE..yellow is a good color......PROTIEN......im eating it while i type this review  CONS______small 11.5 ounce boxes.....HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST......you dont have any......you have to spend money on this........when its gone you become very sad.....your always wanting more but have to wait for the next order...  5 stars out of 5,4

1920,"There's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!",4
1924,"I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I'm so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great-niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive, convenient, and organic.  Best of all . . . He likes it!  I'm setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson. CORRECTION!  The product I ordered two weeks ago was $7.76 a case.  Now the cost is $11.03.  That's quite a price hike.  Is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down?",4
1930,"When I ordered, I did not realized this item was seasoned. It is & I don't like the taste. I wanted PLAIN organic mashed potatoes. I got 6 boxes of these. Be careful what you order in grocery.",4
1938,"Full of pulp, which my daughter loves!! I only wish they came in glass and not a can...",4
1939,"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.  As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.  I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.  I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The ""clusters"" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.  All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods.",4
1948,"I am a very satisfied customer in which, will purchase again. I couldn't receive them fast enough.  Thank You,",4
1959,Drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. The drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. I would not purchase again.,4
1963,got this on sale here for 8.00 which is just 1 dollars more then wholesale price.,4
1965,"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!",4
1966,"I ordered this item on March 22nd.  I expect to get its replacement from the people at Blue sometime today.  So, what's a month, anyway?  The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  That's always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe I'll like it.  Blue's products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally.",4
1969,Its a great tasting energy boost.  I've tried a few of the energy drinks out there and never liked the taste or the jittery feeling I got.  I highly recommend the Raspberry Acai drink!,4
1974,"I ordered these to make sachets for baby shower favors. I added my own sage and lavender colored ribbon after filing them with lavender (from the same supplier). They look like I spent a fortune on them but I didn't! I have left-overs which I plan on using for gifts, tea bags, and also to make oil infusions with. I'm quite pleased with them!",4
1977,A lot cheaper than the store and the bulk will make it last a little longer than usual. Always great flavor and constancy with this product,4
1982,I was buying these at my vet for more than twice the price; My beagles love them; they are their favorite snack. Super fast shipping too!,4
1991,"I like the product and bought because I was not able to find it here locally though I had previosly purchased it at CostCo (Charleston, SC).  I should have looked more closely at the price because I was shocked I paid almost $70 for three 40 oz. jars.  My fault, but I will not be ordering any more on line.",4
1992,"I had this cake for my birthday.  It was delicious.  It was nice and moist and fluffy, and tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust.  (I like the filling for pumpkin pie).  No bad aftertaste or anything at all.  We put a dollop of Cool Whip on top instead of frosting.  We have had other Sweet n Low cakes in the past, and they have unfortunately tasted lousy.  This was a pleasant surprise.",4
1995,This lo carb pancake mix is really good and easy to make.  You can't even tell it's a lo carb product. I made some pancakes with it and give one to my boyfriend. He couldn't even tell it was a lo carb product.  I would buy this again.,4
1998,"This price does not even begin to be competitive with my local grocery stores, let alone Sam's Club or Walmart.",4
1999,love crispix but don't like to have to go to the store often so I try online food shopping and for some items this is the way to go. Cheaper than regular price at the store for this large size of box,4
2000,"The other reviewers are CORRECT. I thought I would buy this in spite of the reviews because it was the only product available without traveling into a bigger town where there are Asian markets.  This is a huge waste of money. Totally tasteless, Couldn't even fix it by adding spices and basil. Stay away.",4
2011,"This is a tea that tastes wonderful.  It has many positive attributes, also.  It comes in this large box, 100 count bags.  I received good and speedy service from this seller.",4
2012,"I purchased 5 boxes of these. I really enjoy the taste and nutritional value of the bars. Great starter, mid day pick me up or evening snack (dip into milk). These are crunchy. Great price & excellent Amazon service!",4
2015,This candy jar is great! My daughter loves Hello Kitty and she was so excited to see this candy jar.  Very durable and easy to fill.,4
2024,"This is great tasting ketchup. I waited till I found one before introducing my kids ( ages 2 and 3) now I don't care what they eat ""red dip"" with. Hubby also said he liked it better than our regular ketchup.",4
2027,I hate popcorn but I loved this popcorn. It's crunchy and sweet but not over-poweringly so. The seller delivered the product extremely fast and way before planned. I would surely buy this product again and from this seller again.,4
2028,"We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping.  Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid.  There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess.  Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product.  Save your money.",4
2033,"My son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it.  It seems to be doing well thus far, hopefully it will continue to thrive.  It was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping.",4
2036,These dates are as close as you can get without picking them off the tree yourself. They are also much cheaper than the nearly $8/lb. at local stores that aren't even organic. Great deal for a great product.,4
2040,I LOVE this trail mix...it's sooo good! Although the cost is more expensive on here than I pay at the store. Will continue to buy in-store.,4
2041,"This Flaxseed meal is the best EVER!  I've tried several brands that I purchased in local markets but it's not that easy to find whole ground flaxseed around where I live. So the ones I was able to find had a sand-like texture (and taste), my wife couldn't stand it despite of the known benefits of taking it.  This flaxseed texture is awesome for her and she's enjoying it! She mixes with milk in the morning and smoothie in the afternoon and doesn't complain anymore about the taste.  I take it before the meals with juice and I think it has a wonderful nutty taste.  I had initially setup the subscription for every 6 months, but we liked it so much, we are changing it for every 3 months!",4
2049,I've purchased cheaper bags since buying these which work well.  These are thicker and cheaper here than at a pet store.,4
2050,"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.  Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.",4
2054,"This is one of my all-time favorite candies.  Lays used to have a slogan, ""Bet you can't eat just one!"" and there's no doubt, for me, that's the case with these.  My biggest 'problem' with these is I can't leave them alone and my waistline is suggesting I SHOULD!",4
2059,I bought this to share with my co-workers and in one week they are gone.,4
2060,"Love these, but $6.65 per package????  That's crazy when they went for $2.50-3.50 in the stores (Meijer, Walmart, Kroger).  Nice flavor and my favorite but no way would pay this much for what is essentially sugarfree koolaid.",4
2061,"Bottled water is just about all the same to me so I look for price. Even with the shipping cost, this 24 pack is the best bargain I've seen. It's cheaper than in my local grocery store and I don't have to carry it home.",4
2064,Not Kosher!!! Ignore the Symbol!!! They are NOT Kosher and NOT certified by any company!!! I contacted the company to confirm.,4
2065,"Love the large size Gevalia morning roast.  It makes about 1 1/2 mugs of coffee.  Just enough to keep you going through the morning.  The flavor is perfect, not too strong and not bitter.  The three pack is a great value.  This price is way better than buying from the grocery store or department stores.  A wonderful way to start your day.",4
2066,"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.   My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too? For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",4
2070,"My son is on a Gluten Free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category, and that taste good enough for him to eat...is very hard.  He loves these bars.  He thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could. They are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that.  These bars are on average, pretty expensive in the stores, but I can purchase them off Amazon for much cheaper and I usually buy them in bulk. If you have a picky eater, or if anyone is on a specific diet, these might be something to consider.  As many know, it is hard to find Gluten free snack products that taste very similiar to regular ones and these really do make the cut.  EnviroKidz Organic Koala Crispy Rice Bars, Chocolate, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)",4
2076,"The fruit arrived in a timely fashion, but much of the fruit was not ripe, and quality was very poor.  Most of the fruit delivered was fruit easily obtainable at most grovery stores for a fraction of what was charged for this basket.  Don't waste your money!",4
2090,"This really does taste a lot (not exactly) like regular bubble gum. It's thick, chunky, and kid's can make huge pink bubbles with it, and it lasts and lasts. As a treat you don't have to worry about for a child, or as a diet item for an adult, this is great.",4
2096,"I debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile, but my shipment had no problems. Ha, maybe I'd trust Amazon and UPS more than the people they've got working down at the grocery store.  Another reason I debated ordering was of course, the salt, and of course being ""SALTines"", there's a bunch of it. I haven't compared a lot of other snacks, but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives. I guess because there's no other tastes that they have to mask, the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through. I don't normally worry about such things as health and nutrition, but 12 boxes is a lot, and I tend to chow down on a lot of them because they're so good!  Plenty of time left on the expiration date, 8 months from now, so that's not a worry.  Prices, as with everything, fluctuate, but I got a good deal.",4
2099,Much fresher than the usual sun maid i buy at store. Less sugar too so they taste at a much higher quality. I will continue to buy these in bulk to save $. Hopefully the seller is reading my interview and sends me a code for discount since I gave a generous review,4
2102,My family loves maple syrup on pancakes and by far this is one of the best we have tasted. We love it!,4
2105,"Ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion. The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put ""This side up"" on the box. The dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant (Audrey) was upside down, roots up in the box. If I had found one locally I would have bought it there. Hoping Audrey survives, but I don't have high hopes. EDIT: Audrey is now deceased. Do not recommend.",4
2108,Excellent snack that's healthy and nutricious.  My son loves it!  It is a tad pricier than other brands but it tastes better.,4
2109,"I've been eating raw honey for a while now and this is among the best tasting that I've tried.  It was also reasonably priced, unlike some of the other raw honey products that give you a tiny jar for the same price (or more) than I paid for this large 3-pounder.",4
2120,"... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it.",4
2137,"i was a little disappointed,it does not taste like the eel i remembered.this is very muschi,i dont think i order it again.///karin",4
2139,Been buying Haribo products for 40 years.  Noticed they even are starting to put some sugar back into  their products. Tasty as usual.,4
2143,"Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck.",4
2153,"This ended up being exactly what I was looking for!  I purchased a slew of nostalgic candy for my 30th birthday party.  When I came across Fun Dip, the only ones I could find anywhere were the individually packaged flavor packs.  Amazon actually had the big packs (that I grew up with) with the two sugar sticks and three different flavored sugar packs.  If that's what you're looking for, this is your product!  (On a side note, the candies were a big hit!)",4
2154,This buckwheat flour is a great value and the quality is excellent.  I received promt answers to my questions from the company and found the customer service to be excellent.  I'll definitly be purchasing this flour again.,4
2169,"This product is the best raw honey...  Growing up, my dad had bee hives in South Louisiana and this is exactly how I remember the taste of raw honey.  I highly recommend this product.",4
2170,"I buy these at a local grocery store, not from amazon.com.  They are absolutely lovely. Light and crisp, they're like naked Cheetos, that are actually fairly healthy. They can be topped with most anything, sweet or savory. Great for midnight snacks, afternoon snacks, or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner. Wish they'd make them in flavors, they'd beat the pants off most ""diet"" snacks I've ever seen!",4
2171,Fast service the items arrived the next day - Our dog loves them and they make great stocking stuffers for the holidays for our dog and the neighbors.,4
2172,These are tasty enough for an emergency snack/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijer's sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that.,4
2177,Seriously I didn't taste it but my dogs love these.  Shipping was very fast... I received them within 2 or 3 days of ordering.  Good price.,4
2179,This product is pretty delicious.  I love using stevia instead of other fake sugars because it's a natural product and seems less likely to cause cancer.  I wish more things would use it instead!,4
2181,"I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me...",4
2190,"I like this produce because it added up favor in my smoothies. Good for health, and easy to use. But the price is a little too high.",4
2192,"Great seller, a great customer service ,outstanding value & good tasting Italian coffee I will be back after I drink all of my coffee that I purchased to purchase another back from the seller I have advise you people to do the same.",4
2194,$136 for 12 boxes?  Is this a rare item?  That's $11.33 a box.  I think the item might be a bit overpriced.,4
2199,"My first time eating Kelp Noodles. They taste great. Now I just need to find them locally so that i will not have to place an order for food. Nevertheless, recommend this company and their Kelp.",4
2200,I have used this product many rimes and it is the Best tasting product for cole slaw.  I am now having a hard time finding it again but I asked Walmart if they are going to sell it again and told me to check after Feb.  I have used it for parties and my guest think that is really great and I never have any left overs.  Thanks for a great tasting slaw mix.,4
2210,Cremora is a fine product but very hard to find. It is available online but at ridiculous prices.Would be pleased to find an alternate source.,4
2213,They kept raising the price. The product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. This last order I have had enough and will be going back!,4
2222,"I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . .",4
2225,"This item is highly overpriced!  After purchasing, I found this in the store for $3.98.  I won't be ordering from here again.",4
2227,This price is amazing! We are a whole foods family and we use this for our baking and on our waffles and we love it! Way cheaper then the grocery store!,4
2228,"My son loves these for self feeding and it's a good snack on the road, in the car or whenever you go to a restuarant and need to keep them busy. My son loves them, and even I do!",4
2230,This product is WAY over priced.  I bought the same thing for $4.29 at my local Safeway and K-Mart.  My two dogs love them and I give them as a treat.,4
2237,This tastes great although I do add a little more cinnamon. It does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product.,4
2250,I have used 3 of the 6 bags so far and have been pleasantly surprised at how few bad beans are in each bag.  Excellent quality.,4
2257,you can buy same pack from grocery store for $6:50. anyone who would buy this for that expensive price will be stupid.,4
2268,We keep a box of these in our supply bin in the back of our vehicle for snacks on the go.  Yummy!,4
2277,I add a tbsp of this flaxseed to our morning smoothies for health benefits.  Amazon sells the product for almost half the price I have found at local grocery stores. Keep the open bag in the freezer to preserve freshness.,4
2280,"I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldn't breathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage.",4
2281,These snacks are great but the price is beyond absurd.  These are $3 - $3.50 each in Wal-Mart.  Here it is $7 each.  Price gouging at it's best.  What a joke.,4
2286,"I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.",4
2292,"Much cheaper at costco  much much much much much much, a lot a lot a lot cheaper. like $ 10.00 bucks",4
2298,"My kids love Hamburger Helper so I figured this would be a great new product to try since anything with Velveta is good!  It was easy to make and only took a few minutes to complete.  The kids absolutely loved it and I thought it tasted great too.  My only complaint was that, visually, it was unappetizing.  It didn't look like the picture on the box.  It was kind of a grayish brown color and actually worried me a bit before I tried it.  Luckily, my kids and I don't really care how it looks so we all enjoyed it, but Kraft would benefit by working on presentation.",4
2300,"Milo was my daily equivalent of coffee back in Singapore, but now that I moved to the US, I was shocked to find that the grocery stores near where I live does not sell this drink. So I was glad to find it on Amazon and it tastes as great. Reminds me of home too :) I hope it gets restocked soon though ._.",4
2301,"Wasabi peas are delicious, healthy, natural, and a great alternative to less healthy snacks. However, these particular Wasabi peas are way over priced. You're much better off buying in bulk, like these excellent  Wasabi Peas . They are just as tasty, and much, much cheaper.",4
2309,"I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack.  When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order.  I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1/3 of my $105 charged price.",4
2313,"Bars tasted good, were fresh, and I am pooping better! I would recommend this product to anyone. And they are cheap!",4
2324,"this is regularly $2.50 per 12pk on sale at local grocery stores, even the MSRP is only $4.99 Buyer Beware !",4
2329,I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!,4
2331,Tasty.  Better than others I've bought and good price.  The bag helps keep them moist too as opposed to the canisters.,4
2334,"It was pleasant to receive these in good condition. The cups were inside a cardboard box while inside another main cardboard box with bubble padding, none of the cups broke.",4
2346,"A delicious product, can't seem to find it in the stores these days. I recommend to try if you like pork rinds. Quick Delivery and great to have for guests.",4
2347,"great product, tastes great, love being able to buy in bulk at a good price, rivals generic prices. well worth it!",4
2348,I was so glad to find this on amazon and free shipping with the subscribe and save. It's much cheaper than buying smaller bags in town. I mix it with regular oatmeal to stretch it and its so healthy for you.  I haven't tried baking with it but am a total addict when it comes to eating it for breakfast as a hot cereal.,4
2349,"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: ""supreme"" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the ""supreme"" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully.",4
2352,"These are quite good tasting!  Even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time, the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time.  It would be nice, as with most things, if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk,' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings.",4
2357,I was very disappointed when Target stopped selling these.  I bought this pack of 12 bags and they were just like from the store.  Good buy.,4
2367,I found this exact same product elsewher for a much better price. It was only $11.99 per bag. Why is there such a difference? Dried Cherries 20oz. ~ Resealable Bag  Dried Cherries 20oz. ~ Resealable Bag,4
2372,I was able to get a bottle for $1.00 through a relay for life food sale.  This is the best juice ever!,4
2380,but i ran out and now i see that the price has increased from 81.00 to 131.00 while it is still i'm sure a good deal that's a sharp increase.,4
2381,I would have given this a 5 star but the container was not completely sealed. I took off the cap and the seal was partially lifted up. I have used it several times and the flavor is great.,4
2388,This is the best Waffle Mix around. Can't find in the store but glad that I was able to find them online for such a reasonable price.......,4
2394,"DESCRIPTION:  Lightly roasted and lightly salted; with no added oil  SIZE:  11oz bags  EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful, however some are under-roasted and not crunchy.  A few nuts taste stale. > Blue Diamond brand almonds, moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil and lightly salted are more flavorful.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  The longer or more intense roasting makes the nuts crunchier.  PRICE COMPARISON:  At the time of this writing, both ""Back-to-Nature"" and ""Blue Diamond"" almonds are about 50 cents/oz  Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)   The Blue Diamond almonds come in more convenient 6 oz cans, but may be less environmental freindly.",4
2397,"I got a pack of these for free with my last order! Thanks Pier Mall! Very tasty cookie cracker snack, with a light touch of honey flavor. My friends liked it too. I will definitely buy some with my next order.",4
2403,"Got some of this on sale at the local grocery store today..was impressed with the taste. The energy boost isn't much different from other products to me. However, the taste is something I'd actually drink as a regular drink! Impressive since many energy drinks are foul tasting..",4
2404,"I used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in China! Not trusting this company anymore, they just lost another customer. BUYER BEWARE!",4
2407,"I recently found out about these products and I love this breakfast sausages. I have tried the other product:  Cedar Lake Tasty Link, 20 Oz. Cans (Case of 12, Vegan) , they both taste good but I like these better. Healthy yet tasty!",4
2412,"Really pricey.  I think a 45-gallon barrel is that much at the warehouse.  I first cancelled, they did not respond so I went ahead and accepted.  Certainly not economical.",4
2415,"I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin.  The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95.  This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less.",4
2436,"There's a very nice watermelon flavor to these candies.  If I had any complaint...and I really don't...it would be that I'd prefer the candies individually wrapped.  Otherwise, I'm pleased with my selection.",4
2438,I love these biscottis. They are 15 calories each and taste wonderful. Because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren't cheap. However I got them here for about 30% less than the other vendor I used online.,4
2446,I bought this seed to make centerpieces for a safari-themed baby shower. I did a test run with one planter last week. They sprouted beautifully - and close to 100% germination. The grass is tall and healthy (within only 8 days).,4
2453,I think this is a really good deal. I seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew. Good stuff!,4
2455,"We found this at PF Changs, and it tastes just as great as it did there. There are 16 bags per box as listed.",4
2459,Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.,4
2463,"Our Allsorts licorice arrived quickly - in time for a birthday surprise!  It's hard to find this great licorice anywhere locally, and when you do, it's very expensive.  We were delighted with the price, service and most of all - taste!",4
2464,"This is by far the best Teriyaki Jerky I have tasted. It is a thick cut, salty, sweet and tender. The price is the only thing that is no good. I would buy more if it was bulk or reasonable but this seems to be the only place to purchase. I am a repeat customer and will continue. Thanks!!",4
2465,"I had no idea exactly how much a pound of flowers would be. Great quality and very plentiful. Arrived in an airtight bag, so I'm sure it will stay fresh for months. I use it with mint to make wanjo.",4
2468,"This honey is very spreadable, more like jelly than honey, and very tasty. The jar it comes in may be small, but it is more than worth the price.",4
2475,"I know what you're probably thinking: They're vegan, they're gluten-free...they're a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana-y but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!  PS If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!",4
2480,I guess it does the job okay.  And it's much cheaper than 5-Hour brand.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel. The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company. I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.,4
2482,Hard to find Item. Delicious and easy to prepare. Kids love it! Arrived very fast!,4
2485,"I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Don't waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other ""Peppered"" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle.",4
2486,"My oldest son likes this coffee and its price and suggested I use it for guests at our rental vacation property. I do use the coffee and have never had a complaint from any of our guests. I generally buy the original ground or decaff original and am pleased with both. By using 'Subscribe and Save' this coffee is cheaper than any local store, including using a Eight O'Clock coupon at either Walmart or Target.",4
2487,"Well, what kind of review can I write for snack bites. I was quite surprised by their taste, which is very good. I wish they were available in bigger packages, otherwise the packaging itself costs more than the bites. That's the reason for 4 stars(I mean the cellophane costs as much as the meat).",4
2491,The candy was fresh and tasted really good. It definitely was not hanging around some warehouse somewhere. I would order from this company again with no hesitation.,4
2511,we go on a lot of road trips and i always make sure to pack quaker bars as the kids love them they are great taste good and so easy to pack highley reccommend these to anyone as a to go snack,4
2516,"I like the product, but at nearly [...] bucks per 24 pack it is way overpriced. I would buy it again if it was priced at about 40% less.  I do like it for an afternoon boost, but in the mornings I need full strength rocket fuel.",4
2519,This is the easiest and tastiest applesauce cake with out the hassle .  Everyone will think you made it fromscratch.,4
2520,These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture. They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.  I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.,4
2521,It has only a few calories and is even suitable for my husband with Diabetics II. Very fast to prepare before cooking the meal for the family or friends. Taste is really good and not too sweet as many other desserts. Great in summertime - put it for half an hour in the freezer and serve it as a semifreddo.,4
2523,Bought this in sept. and did not pay to much attention to price at 16.83  3lb box and then saw them in the store for 7.99. Boy did i feel  like an idiot.  do your comparison shopping and do not waste your money on 3rd party sellers.Update.. Food 4 less had this box for 6.49 good buy and the cookies were fresh this time ?,4
2527,It's a  wonderful snack and an Immune System booster also. I am so happy I found this and I recommended it to all my friends.,4
2530,Stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.,4
2532,I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.,4
2535,"Most of the reviews are mostly negative, but if your brand new to this candy......its sooo delicious! If you like a chewy, hardness..feeling like your jaw is going to fall off. This is the stuff! I'm 16 and never heard of this candy before, but i tried it once at a world market and couldn't stop eating them, there so addicting! They have a great mouth watering taste to them. I would recommend this candy to new comers.",4
2536,"3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  But I don't think that should keep anyone from getting this product.",4
2542,"It clearly states on the description, pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I don't want to return.",4
2546,I can't believe I paid here over $11..big mistake on my part should checked local first... just paid under $ 3.00 for 16 oz at our local Publix  rated a 5 * for the item...,4
2549,Great taste and goes with all types of mexican food.  Have used for years and all of a sudden this product extremely hard to find at grocery stores and Walmart.  So was pleased I could order and shipment was here quickly.,4
2550,This is part of my regular order now.  I love it!  I used it when I did the Master Cleanse and it was perfect.,4
2551,So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...,4
2555,"First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought!",4
2558,"I bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we've purchased, but I got this one for 30-50% less!  Great buy.",4
2567,"Great product.  Received it in a timely manner.  If you like tea, this is a keeper.",4
2568,Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again.,4
2576,"This is an excellent quality product. It makes lunch or a snack time very easy and convenient, as well as nutricious.  LOVE this product.  awesome for controlling portions for anyone looking to maintain weight as well.",4
2580,"I love these crackers but not the price change.  At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for ""Subscribe and Save"" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for ""Subscribe and Save"" delivery.  Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.  Bait and switch?  I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.  As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a ""Prime"" member.  I'll need to cancel my ""Subscribe and Save"" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.  I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.  It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!  Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.",4
2586,I love this cereal.  I first had it at my sisters and now I am hooked.  I love the fact that it has good grains and that it is organic so this seems a good cereal (as cereals go).  I love the taste a little sweet and crunch.  And the price at $3.10 a box is really good.,4

2593,We did the shopping season for Christmas. They indicated that the product would arrive by 18 January. To our surprise came before Christmas in excellent condition. Thoroughly recommended!,4
2598,"This is a very welcome product.  It is so difficult today to find any candies that are made without GMO's.  Having said that I must also say that I was astounded at the price listed.  I purchased these candies in a local supermarket for $3 a bag.  That is THREE, not thirty [when you add shipping].  Unreal's website lists many stores that will soon be carrying these products.  They are great everyday type candies I would recommend to anyone but not at the price listed.",4
2601,This is what you need to make your gumbo taste the way it should. It is difficult to find in stores and I was happy to be able to get it from Amazon.,4
2602,Most stores don't carry product but is the best and easy to fix spaghetti on the planet you can buy.,4
2604,They are taking advantage of pricing and selling this item at 200% mark up. You can get it at Keurig.com at half the price,4
2607,"Very good flavor and not filled with a bunch of chemicals. Although there are still questions about some of the ingredients, it is a great alternative to what's on the shelf in the grocery store.",4
2613,"I ordered this product for my niece as one of her Christmas presents. When I opened the UPS package, the handle to the gingerbread box was broken. The box was also dented in places. The taste of the icing was horrible. However it was a fun project and none of the gingerbread pieces were broken. Would not buy again.",4
2614,I found this site to have the best price for the quantities on the web. I would definitely order from here again.,4
2616,"I was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken.  I wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested (both suggested the same wrappers.... hmmm) However, the wrappers arrived intact.  In fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage.  I detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an Asian market.  Buying in bulk saved lots of $$.  There were a couple of wrappers - out of dozens -that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them.  It didn't affect the taste or function.  That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  We weren't wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasn't a problem.  We will definitely order again.  Shipping was rapid.  A great buying experience.",4
2620,I don't buy my walnuts anywhere else. These taste great and are a fantastic price. I put most of them in the freezer and pull them out as I need them in order to ensure they stay fresh since 4 tubs lasts me quite a while.,4
2625,"The new Cheez-It Mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting. The crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as I greedily shoveled them into my mouth. I had to shovel them, because the crackers were broken into crumbs when I received them. This however in no way detracted from the flavor or deterred me from the swift completion of my appointed task. Wait, I think I missed one. Mmmmm",4
2630,All the cures work and taste great. I like hickory smoked/flavored items so this was great for me. Great seasoning.,4
2633,This Kit Kat is way way way better than the US version....It is the same one that I used to eat in the middle east but it's very delicious and I do recommend it.  the shipping was fast...the chocolate wasn't melted...and the packaging was good,4
2634,"I purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and I'm not impressed at all. I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops, but in the description it says there's 16. I would have expected that if I knew they were coming from Oriental Trading Company, but that's not in the description, so I feel ripped off.",4
2643,"the item is awesome, but the 6 pack is about $30 at babies r us, this is a rip-off",4
2645,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same.",4
2654,"I bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. The other night I decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. It was so bad I couldn't believe it. It wasn't spoiled, it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. It didn't even taste like caviar. I threw the jar away.",4
2678,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one.",4

2687,"Bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great! Too bad I don't have one of those machines, otherwise, I'd try them out myself.  I might have to consider getting one! If you really like it, you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don't run out.",4
2688,"This is a really great tasting snack with the right amount of kick.  I bought a 24OZ bag from my local Waldbaums for $6.49.  There was a buy one get one free sale, so I actually got 48OZs for $6.49.  Totally worth it.",4
2689,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise.",4
2698,The Tempura was a gift for a host. They reported great taste. There really isn't much else to say about it. I would order again based on taste and service.,4

2714,We have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies. During a walk for FAAN they gave out samples of this cookie. My child loved it and wanted more. At the time they did not carry it in the stores so I found it online. It was a great purchase. It came when expected and the cookies disappeared fast. I will be ordering more soon. :),4

2736,"Narnia???  I first had Turkish delight while I was in Turkey.  There, shops produce Turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh.  Every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. The sweetness of Turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box.  I think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative.  If you can't fit a quick trip Turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute I've tried.  I wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and I wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through Amazon I trust.  Tangentially, if you like Turkish delight, you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin, because there's many other delicious Turkish confections you probably haven't experienced.",4
2738,"Regular Reduced fat milk from Horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date. My intention was to buy Whole milk but the product description is confusing. I sent an email to the customer support - no response, after 3 weeks I checked and found that they made the picture larger (good) but left the product description without change. As for me, it is crazy expensive shipping while I can get same Fat free or Reduced fat milk at StopNShop or Market Basket. The difficult thing is to find whole milk. Funny that Whole milk as natural product became unpopular. I guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight:)",4
2742,"The jerky has a plesant taste, not overly fishy. Some of the pieces were highly seasoned. Some of the pieces were signifigantly drier than others but overall I recommend the product.",4

2769,The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.,4
2777,"These are beautiful, smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads, ""New technology"", so, I'm figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well. I was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but I'm glad I took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands.  Will definitely order these again!",4

2787,"Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.  This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item. A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering. Anyone want some tuna? O well.  P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)",4
2788,"Great meal replacement drink that tastes great!  You get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients.  I prepare one of these whenever I'm on the go and I won't have to worry about missing a meal.  The best bang for your buck, especially if you subscribe to the Amazon subscribe and save program.",4
2789,This is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store.  If you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity.  This is a good deal and super easy to use.,4
2794,"This would have gotten 5 stars but I decided 4 due to the fact it is pricey and I feel it could be more reasonably priced than it is.  Otherwise, I was hoping it would be my answer to a saltine cracker that I miss so much due to being gluten-intolerant.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The cracker was very tasty and had a nice crunch.  It is perfect to crumble in tomato soup or to eat plain or with anything on it.  I really love this product.  It makes a great snack when I just have to have something to crunch on:)",4
2796,Everyone that tastes these chips LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!! They all ask where they can get them.  Thank you for the email on when they were back in stock. I will be ordering more. My grandkids @ children raid the cupboards for them when they come by.,4
2800,You can smell the spinach! It seems fresh and tastes wonderful. I fed it to my 2nd son when we were on the go during his babyfood stage and gave it to my preschooler as a snack. Now both often reach for these as a snack and I'm happy to offer them something other than cheerios or graham crackers when we're on the go.,4
2808,Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag,4

2828,"My dad loves this product, the local stores sell one small box for an excess of $5.00 for one 8oz box.  He eats this desert everyday now that we have enough.  It tastes just as good as the store bought product for a fraction of the cost.  Great Product!",4
2830,"I was skeptical to buy this because I've bought ""cheap"" coffee before I'm always disappointed with its taste.  This tastes great and the environmental factor is just a bonus for me!",4
2836,I purchased this as a present but it doesn't come As shown in the picture.  It is little white bags with the flavor written on them.  Someone receiving it as a gift wouldn't even know what it was unless I explained it to them. Will be returning.,4
2837,"The purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good, and made my home in plenty of time for Christmas.  The box was opened the day after new years.  The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.  They would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller. I still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so.  Then trash can.",4

2852,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!,4
2857,Of the Plum tots pouches I have had this is by far the best tasting. These are a little pricey but when they are on sale they are worth every penny. Great for throwing in a diaper bag or purse.,4
2864,"The Ambrosoli Honees Energy plus Vitamin Caramels were absolutely delicious! You definitely get a caramel taste without the stickiness. I can't speak to the vitamin aspect but it does give you a little energy shake up. I kept a pack in my purse and during long tiring speeches, I sneaked one and it kept me awake. The wrappers are noisy but worth it!",4
2869,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership.",4
2874,"Immediately after placing my order I received an email from the seller with care instructions and specifics on the shipping of the bamboo. When it arrived (exactly when I was expecting it) it was in superb shape. I could tell not only by looking at it, but also by the smell! It was such a nice treat to open the package and be greeted with that fresh, sweet smell! Not only was the quality of the bamboo superb, but it was such a great price! I would absolutely recommend this seller and their products! :)",4
2878,"I was a little apprehensive purchasing this entire 3 lb+ can for consumption by only 2 people. However, now that we've eaten about half the can in a week, I can say that my concern was not valid :)  I LOVE castelvetrano olives, and this brand is fantastic! My plan was to follow the recommendation of another reviewer, and put the olives in a glass jar with water to reduce the brine. But, at the rate we are devouring them, I don't believe that will be necessary.  My only regret is that I didn't purchase more at the same time. I'll stock up on my next purchase.",4

Each is individually bagged and include two great tasting candy refills.  I only got 6 blister packs and only got 3 of the 4 characters. Also the picture showed 12 packages. Obviously they put a ""6 dispensers"" in the title (I thought that to be a misprint) and took a 12 pack and busted it down and sent me half for the price that was for 12. RIP OFF!!!",4
2886,"I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4"" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".  What difference does it make?  Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!  Will not order again from this supplier.",4
2887,"You know how limited your food choices can be when your plane is delayed and the airport is pretty much closing down for the night? Well, that's how I found Mrs. Mays Cran-Blueberry Crunch.  The candy and gum kiosk at LaGuardia carries them, and I was not going to make it tbrough a 2 hour delay on a Snickers.  The Cran-Blueberry Crunch was wonderful.  Hit the spot and carried through with no sugar crash.  They're delicious without being overly sweet and the fruit is real fruit, not dried fruit with yucky preservatives.  When I got hom, I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered a case from Amazon, and I keep a bag in my desk drawer (for that late afternoon snack attack).  I've shared with my friends, and everyone loves it.  Enjoy!!",4

2902,"I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (""Movie Size"" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again.",4
2907,I bought a 25 lb bag of red quinoa from this company. We are pleased with both the taste and the price. It's a much better deal than buying quinoa in small packages. I hardly use rice anymore because the quinoa tastes better and has more protein.,4
2908,"I love to eat it as a snack while reading; before I know it, the jar is empty.  But I buy it from Plum Market online for $5.",4
2912,Good Product for a good price.  Would order again and probably when our pup gets to be an adult we we order the adult food.,4

2919,"During my recent visit to New Orleans in June of 2012, I fell in love with Etouffee' sauce on redfish.  Oh my goodness. Delicious.  I picked up a few packages of the Louisiana Cajun Etouffee Mix, for $2.00 per package, and made it at home. It was fantastic.  I ordered the product on Amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars, was delivered one package. The product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount...I assumed three packages for that price. I received one package and returned it to them immediately.  You can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping.  So, avoid purchasing this via this seller.  Great product however.",4
2929,As will all of Bob's red mill products these are excellent!  The cost in buying in bulk from Amazon is much lower than the cost at our local coop and I like this produce better.  Does not really require any soaking before cooking.,4
2933,I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.  For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey.,4
2943,"I ordered these because I couldnt seem to find this size at the store. There were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product, but everything else was fine.",4
2948,"The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor.",4
2950,Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.,4
2951,"The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.  Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.  Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.  If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!",4
2952,"I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.  I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket.",4

2981,"I ordered this item in a large quanity, but wanted the items packaged as shown.  They were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees.  When they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose.  If I had know they would come like this I would have gone to COSTO or some other discount store for the purchase.  The cute little box that would have helped make them special and what I thought I paid for was missing.",4
2982,Keenan's pistachios are great. I love having the no-salt option. The nuts are fresh with a very good flavor. Finding a clunker (inedible nut) in the bag is very rare.,4

2986,"I live in Texas. While visiting our daughter in SD recently, she purchased these at her local grocery store. She served as salad topping, but then we ate a couple of packages by the handfuls. I went back the next morning on our way back home and purchased all they had in the maple and cinnamon flavors. I emailed the company and asked where I could buy more locally (Texas). They advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the Midwest basically, but that I could order through Amazon! I am thrilled! These are fantastic! a little on the expensive side, but just learn to ""pace yourself"" and not eat too many! Maple is our favorite; cinnamon is good too; haven't tried banana flavor. Enjoy!",4

2997,"I've made these for friends (both gluten-intolerant and not), and everybody loves these! They do not taste like they're gluten-free! Excellent job by Nuffins to mix convenience with quality and health.",4
3005,"Nowadays, it's really difficult to get a really natural Pineapple fruit, specially where I live, but this product is just fantastic! You can feel the smell and the flavor of a natural pineapple. Thank you!",4
3009,"I love this cereal!!! I,ve been eating it for months  ,and  did not tired yet...",4
3014,This company protected these cookies very well with great packaging but the taste is not there.  I would never purchase again.,4
3015,"I have gotten this product in smaller jars before and was very pleased so to save money I ordered the gallon tub. The coconut oil in the tub seems to have less flavor than the jars or maybe it was that particular batch. I'll know better after I try the next 1 gallon tub. I will order this product again.  May 2011, I am half way thru my second gallon of this product and the taste is very good. My only wish now is that it was cold pressed/unheated.",4
3018,was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds...,4
3019,"Zero stars for this item.  I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.  As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored.",4
3023,"I am doing the ""subscribe and save"" thing with these crackers. I thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes, but boy was I wrong. Already we're halfway through the boxes. Time to order more!",4
3027,"My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product.",4
3035,"Love this seasoning. Delicious for my steak. Couldn't find this where I live, so I was really happy to find it on Amazon. Great price!",4
3038,"These noodles take just a couple of minutes to make and there is only one flavoring pack.  IndoMie noodles are absolutely fantastic and cheaper, but take a little more effort to make - I buy both brands and use as the mood strikes me.  The reason I'm writing a review, however, is more about the price.  Every Asian store I've been to that sells this noodle pack charges around .68, so it's definitely worth buying these at an Asian store (though not all Asian stores sell Sapporo).  I'm hoping Amazon will start selling the boxes of these for less than the Asian stores sell single packets! (Hint . . . hint, Amazon.) Just a note,too - IndoMie noodles are about half the price of these, at least at the Asian markets.",4
3046,I have been purchasing this product for about 9 months.  The taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. I have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all.  Have contacted the manufacturer 2 times.  Have not received a response from my latest inquiry. I don't recommend purchasing.,4
3051,I have been buying pig ears for my brother dogs for over ten years. These were the best quality that I ever purchase. They were bigger and the quality is just as good then what I purchase from other online stores.,4
3052,"I was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago, and one day at my local market happened upon this product.  It was like I finally had stepped back into the world of taste. If you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them.  So now I can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever I like and if I purchase it through amazon by the case, shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market.  Give it a try!",4
3054,I've been having this product delivered for a long time and it always beats local prices. Also saves me from trying to find it on sale at the local market.,4
3055,Product is good and came in a timely matter. The price was way higher than at the Asian store. I found it for a 1/3rd of the price. So I can buy 3 5lb bags at the store compared to this price for the same amount.,4
3056,"I bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly.  They are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that ""snacky"" feeling.  These are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light (for example, on a flight or road trip).  I highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well.  They have this snack in Chicken, Turkey and Beef in various flavors.",4
3063,"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts.  However, the unit description is incorrect.  It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars.",4
3068,"We were disappointed when we could no longer obtain Violet Crumbles in the U.S. Then we discovered the Crunchie. Almost identical but better. These bars arrived on time and is perfect condition. None of the bars broken and no bloom. Nice, light, chocolate-covered sea foam in perfect condition.",4
3070,"I got this at a GREAT PRICE. I paid $8.67 ($10.20 without Subscribe and save) for 3 boxes that contain 4 separate 24oz bags. So you see, is a whole bunch of cookies. I'm abroad but I hear that my stepson's reaction was WOW, they'll all be gone tomorrow (teenager - resembles a bottomless pit) but it was a very good price. Cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate. Will buy again. Btw, i just saw that the price on this was $29.95(My favorite things LLC), refresh a couple of times till you see $10.20, (fulfilled by amazon.com)",4
3071,When I started eating these I did not even realized that they were sugarless and low-carb. They are so delicious. The only ones I've tried are peanut butter (I like both crunchy and smooth - don't really seem too different).  I was baffled to see some 1-star reviews but when I read them I saw that everyone was saying that they LOVE these bars BUT got a terrible quality shipment from Amazon. So I should add that I only buy these in local stores - have never purchased from Amazon!,4
3073,"Started eating turkey jerky lately cause its a healthy snack and that's when I came across snackmasters. I have tried the beef, ahi tuna and salmon, all taste great!",4
3088,"I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.  Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.",4
3089,"I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)",4
3095,I am really happy with this product and will definitely buy more products from Andean Treasures in the future. This is a good high quality product that tastes amazing in shakes. Incredibly fast shipping as well. I ordered late Friday evening and received it early mon morning.,4
3099,"I have been drinking Celsius now for around 6-8 months. Prior to that, I had tried several of the other energy drinks out there, and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them. When I first found Celsius, I figured it was too good to be true (it claims to actually burn up to 100 calories per can). While I cannot comment on the calorie burning effect, I do find it has a great taste, the best of any energy drink out there that I have tried, and does give me a ""boost"" of energy. I drink one every morning.  Overall, I love this product. I will purchasing this from Amazon (which was almost $20 cheaper for the 24 pack than the store I normally go to) on a regular basis from now on.",4
3100,These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!,4
3102,"I bougth Yahuda Matzo Style last month.  I wanted to try it before Passover.  I love the taste and texture.  The biggest problem is that about a third of the box I opened arrived in crumbles.  I did not check the other 2 boxes, because I need them unopened for Passover.  I hope the 2 boxes arrived in better condition.  I will try and make matzah balls with the crumbs and use them as a coating or toppng.  At these prices I am not going to waste any of it.  I am going to buy another pack of 3 so that I will have enough to serve during the holiday for myself and family members who can not eat wheat. I hope you keep this item in stock as long as possible as we eat matzah all year long.",4
3105,"These lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers/lollipops.  My children and I are very happy with the taste of these.  The flavors we have tried so far are tasty and strong, and the size is perfect for a special treat.  The 5 pound bag should last us a very long time.",4
3113,I love these!  I found these initially at Sam's and then they discontinued selling them.  I was so glad when I found them on Amazon.  They are such a healthy and tasteful snack! They really taste good and my son and daughter-in-law have started eating them and love them too!,4
3118,"Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast.",4
3130,I brought this because it was on sale but my dogs love this stuff very fresh and moist will order again when on sale:),4
3131,This water is the best tasting water I have ever had. I used it on a plant that had some leaves looking limp and now the plant looks like new. I notice an energy difference each time I drink some. Love it.,4
3134,"These almond butter balls are a unique and delicious snack, chock-full of almond bits all over the exterior of the ""ball."" These provide a nice dose of fiber, protein, and healthy monounsaturated fats, which other snacks often lack. Unlike other Betty Lou's balls, this flavor does not contain whey (dairy) protein, so it is suitable for vegans or dairy-allergy sufferers. Also, just as a tip: these are very soft, so I always ""smush"" (thumb-knead) out the ball until it is a flat square, taking up the entire area of the plastic packaging -- they're much more satisfying to eat (pick at) and last longer that way. A great option when you're sick of ""bars."" I only wish they were organic (hence the missing star) and that Betty Lou's made more dairy-free balls!",4
3138,I have purchased these crackers in the supermarket for twice the price.  these were very fresh and arrived in 4 days.  very good buy,4
3143,"The taste is great. The shipment came in fast. I love it, and so does my entire family. The beans are on the smaller side, but it does not matter to us.",4
3147,I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to.,4
3149,"There was a lot of food in a small package here, which was a pleasant surprise, honestly.  Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.  The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.  And the chocolate square is nummy. :D  The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.  The plus sides are that it is portable, it's tasty and it's quite handy.  Will I buy it again?  I think so, honestly. Sometimes I don't have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case, this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza.  Not an every-day item for me, but as an occasional treat, definitely!",4
3151,"My son loves these snacks for lunch or car rides. I used to buy them at the grocery store in the organic section, but it's less expensive and more convenient to order them through Subscribe and Save. I have tried them as well and they are quite yummy.",4
3156,"I've been eating this stuff for years--it was super simple to prepare as a college student (and has a long shelf life).  Now as a mother, my 3-year-old son loves it, and he's usually picky (note that my son only eats the ""mild"" version of this sauce).  I mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa.  Both ways are fab, but of course it's healthier with quinoa.  It's cheaper at the local Asian market--but if you don't have those nearby, I guess this is the next best place to stock up.",4
3159,"My daughter loves these.  In fact, she loves any type of Annie's bunny crackers.  They are definitely a healthier option for snack crackers.",4
3165,"My kids love these fruit roll ups and I remember having them as a child so I was delighted when I saw I could buy a large box. However, when they came we were disappointed!  The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time).",4
3168,I love this chili! I've seen Amy's products in the supermarket and have been really tempted to purchase any of their products. I've had other meatless products that were awful but this was entirely different experience. I'ts spicy but still holds it flavor and you would never know it's meatless.  I Will definitely order this again.,4
3170,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again.",4
3176,"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.",4
3178,"Not much you can say about this product. the are what it says. the balance between nuts is fair, the price was great, and while I doubt that each package is exactly 100 calories, it is was a great deal.  most important were the price and the nuts. as stated good price compared to local markets (including target) and they ARE FRESH.  nuff said",4
3181,My kids absolutely love these!  They appeal to all my kids from my 6 year old to my 14 year old.  We will be on automatic reorder from now on!!!!,4
3189,"It definitely met my expectations. I thought the quality was great for the price I paid. I would definitely buy this again, from this company.",4
3193,"Great product, but I pay 75 cents per pouch at our local grocery store.  Here they are selling for over 2 dollars a pouch.  I was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price I will keep buying them at the grocery store!",4
3197,"I don't know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.  These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But I'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it's like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7-11 to get some to compare and those at 7-11 were 1000 timex better.  Since it was so cheap to get them it's not worth the hassle to send them back so I think I'll just give them out for halloween.",4
3198,"I have never taken the time to write a review before, but in this case others need to be warned off. I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best.",4
3202,Oh my gosh I had been buying 8oz bottles for $4.99 at the local grocery store when I discovered the excellent price at Amazon!  Even if you give one away it's a better deal than that!  I use agave in my fruit smoothies and this brand is excellent.  A light taste that adds the perfect sweetness.,4
3203,"I also bought this product and I can tell you that I received my shipment in a timely manner and it was worth it!! This cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk, cream or sugar. Just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino. Absolutely worth the price and I saved a ton of $$$ by not purchasing from starbuck's..",4
3204,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING,4
3208,My husband loves his Florida Orange Blossom honey. He was delighted when I found it through Amazon. Now he does not have to wait for  care packages from his brother who lives in Orlando.  Pros: Real Florida Orange Blossom Honey Price Quick shipping  Cons: None,4
3214,I am unable to find a sugar-free syrup that also does not contain sucralose or other detrimental sweeteners at any local stores. Joseph's sugar-free syrup tastes wonderful and fits in with my sugar-free eating plan. I also add it on my oatmeal in place of brown sugar.,4
3218,This mix is really good . . . thanks for making our healthy transition easy.  The whole family enjoyed super healthy pancakes this weekend!,4
3222,love these little crackers and a great price on these will be ordering from this vendor again expiration on these was bout 6 months away,4
3224,The candy received in wonderful packaging. There was no broken pieces and not one button off the paper and the freshness was great,4
3225,"Original description and order said ""Assorted"" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get.",4
3235,So far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee.  It has become really hard to find it at the local stores but Amazon had it even cheaper than I previously paid for it.  It arrived very quickly and I am waiting any day now for the next shipment.,4
3236,These are very good crackers with a very italian cheesy taste. All 4 boxes had quite a few crushed at the bottom of the boxes/bags- bags inside the boxes. I liked them much better than just the regular cheddar ones.,4
3245,I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.,4
3253,I have thouroughly enjoyed preparing and eating this product. Reasonably priced compared to grocery store prices.,4
3257,"The candy was fresh and well-packaged.  I divided into smaller ziploc bags to keep it from going stale (I have no idea how long it would take to go stale, but I wasn't taking any chances) and we ate it over the following months with no complaints.  I just placed an order for another 5 lb bag.",4
3264,"I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A NEGATIVE NUMBER FOR MY REVIEW.....THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED HERE ON AMAZON IN THE LAST 14 YRS OF USING THIS WONDERFUL SITE.  PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT LITERALLY TASTE LIKE ""DIRT"".  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE WHO HAS TRIED THIS PRODUCT HAS LIKED IT....  NOTICED I HAVEN'T CALLED THIS PRODUCT BY IT'S NAME ""CINNAMON"" REASON? BECAUSE IT'S NOT....IT'S DIRT.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO PICK UP MCCORMICKS CINNAMON(WHAT I HAD TO DO).  IF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THIS DIRT READ THIS REVIEW PLEASE CONTACT ME AND LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN GET A REFUND AND RETURN THIS DIRT TO YOU.

3265,I ordered this delicious Kadayif dessert for my sister's birthday with her present that I also bought it at amazon took  them to my parents house to celebrate at their house.everyone at the party enjoyed this delicious kadayif I served it with some turkish coffee it was the best dessert I ever tried everyone said where did I buy it from I said amazon of course they have anything and everything you want to get quality exceptional prices very low.My son told everybody that I live in amazon website because I'm there looking at it everyday to catch those bargains.Thank you amazon as allways bringing us the International flavors to our homes.,4
3266,"These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!",4
3269,this is product is what i always drink after eating my dinner. I love this product. I will deffinitely buy more after 6 months because i purchased 6 boxes of this so they will be good for 6 months.,4
3279,"You can get it much cheaper on Janeskrazy.com! Love it! Works great on just about everything, especially steaks! I also love that it's All Natural. Can't go wrong.",4
3285,Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.,4
3288,"It is very hard finding this item in the stores. I use it on meats,dips and even gravy. It has a great blend of garlic and herbs. I even gave my daughter some of the boxes, now she is hooked",4
3290,"I bought this mix at the local grocery store and was very happy with them. Quick, easy and tasty. My boys love them!",4
3294,"The soup is delicious.......the price is not!  I purchased an 8 pack of this soup for under twenty dollars delivered about 6 months ago direct from Amazon. Unfortunately it looks like we now have to go through a reseller to obtain this product and pay an inflated price, hence the one star rating. I'm down to my last can but I cannot bring myself to pay this much for soup!",4
3296,Highly recommend this flavor pack.  Absolutely love each of them.  My 5 and 7 year olds love them.  So glad I went with these vs the other brand.,4
3298,"Ordered twice and both times they have been excellent. They're fresh and non-broken. Not much more to say other than that, definitely will buy again.",4
3303,These remind of a product called Munchos that I liked a long time ago in regards to flavor. Great crunch and salt level. I wish they packages a bit bigger than the 0.8 and smaller than 3 oz.  The 0.8 isnt quite enough and the 3 is too much. About 1.5 oz would be right for my appetite.,4
3306,"I only use C&H Bakers Sugar for all my baking needs and I go through it FAST with a lot of baking. I looked on Amazon to see if I could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings. At the grocery store, one 4lb carton costs less than $5, so to get three of them, it would cost $15 or less. Here on Amazon it is $28 PLUS $12 shipping. That totals $40 for a $15 product. Yep, that's almost 3 times more expensive than if I just purchase it at the local grocery store. I love Amazon and was really shocked to see this price. This is a definite NO THANKS, I know better than to purchase this item here!",4
3310,This is ridiculous - I shop Amazon all the time and I am definitely pro-Amazon but the price on the package of Thomas English Muffins is insane - $6.95 for one package of 6.  You can purchase a pack at Walmart for $2.  Who would pay this price?  Amazon you get it right 99% of the time and are spot on but maybe not on your food prices.  This is the first time I have checked prices on food.  Today Show just did a segment and I had to check it out - and sure enough your muffins are $6.95.,4
3317,"I love Annie's, but this had no taste, very bland and unappealing. I would not purchase this again, but worst of all I'm stuck with 6 boxes...boo!",4
3321,We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides. We sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business. We have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service & product. We look forward to doing business with you for years to come.,4
3323,These are my favourite flavour of rice crackers.  They are especially great with hummus!,4
3326,"Emerald Cove Organic Toasted Nori Sheets, ever since I found the Emerald toasted Nori I put it everywhere, I make Sushi with brown rice, decorate Fish dishes with shredded Nori and even fish burritos. It has a pleasant fishy taste that I like, each sheet has only 10 calories and each bag contain a packet of moisture-absorbing powder to protect the Nori from dampness.  Also on the back of the bag there is a Pledge of Organic Purity ""All Ingredients Certified Organic - No Ingredients have been Irradiated"" I am glad about that because that was my very first concern. There is a nice and simple Sushi recipe on the back as well and Emerald Cove Nori has no Sodium. Even my Cat likes it! Product of China, Certified Kosher, I like that! Thank You",4
3327,"Fast delivery and excellent quality.  You can use the cinnamon in traditional recipes, on cereal, vebetables, etc.  It naturally has a somewhat sweet taste to it.",4
3345,"These bars were recommended to me by a nutritionist and fitness expert.  They are wonderful.  If you like chocolate, you will love these bars.  They are also very good for you with all organic ingredients.",4
3346,"I've used Fenugreek in the past to increase milk production when I was breast feeding. While I'm currently not breastfeeding, I decided to start taking it again. The reason - it makes your body odors smell like maple syrup! As weird as this may seem, I just wanted to be able to sweat and not smell like onions, and this did the job after taking it for one day. No side effects, other than it does seem to make your bust fuller, not drastically, hardly noticeable, but I can tell a slight difference. I gave it 5 stars since this particular brand seems to be pretty potent compared to what I used to take. I noticed the maple syrup smell after a few days with the old stuff, this worked after one day, and doesn't have a weird smell to it, making it easy for me to swallow.",4
3347,"well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a ""natural"" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.  I personally wouldn't buy this product. 2 stars",4
3351,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.  Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent.",4

3360,"My family loves Bisquick Pancakes, my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. The only problem is the price, I will try Pamelas this week, price seems more reasonable.",4
3364,"While more expensive than most fruit snacks, these are great because there is no sugar added and my kids really like them. I have been buying the Stretch Island brand for several years now, and the price I paid through amazon was decent.",4
3365,"I have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages. Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there's some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see ""plain"". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty ""flavor"" added to them.",4
3368,"this is a nutritious and tasty way to add seasoning to grains, veggies, etc. that's NOT loaded with salt and other preservatives!",4
3371,Case pricing is very favorable.  Great to have a stock on hand for preparing meals for the freezer.  Super quick shipping.,4
3374,"We do not grill steaks if we are out of this product - it really is THAT good. In fact, we have turned so many friends onto this after having them over for perfectly grilled meat (if you love charred outside and medium rare to medium well done - fantastic). We have tried several other flavors they have, and while they are good - this is our favorite by far!!",4
3377,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.,4
3384,I opened my box hoping for a great snack-to-go and what a dissappointment! It tastes like the fat is rancid in these. I opened another box to see if maybe I got a bad box but they were just as awful. My dog won't even eat them.,4
3385,"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page.",4
3388,"Very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our Christmas Cookies.  Tasted good as well, with no bitter or chemical flavor.  A good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies.",4
3389,"I first tasted this product at the grocery store.  I bought the 33oz. container and loved it.  Unfortunately the taset of the ONE coconut water from Amazon was horrible.  IT had a strange taste as if it had been left out in the heat - it was a rancid flavor.  I will not be ordering this again, I'll purchase it from the grocery store where I can take it back easily and quickly.",4
3395,"I was unaware this is not a factory sealed product. That's the only con I would have about this product. It's high quality, tastes great, and a great value. I will purchase again.",4
3400,"Honestly.............I used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store.  So I was actually quite excited to see its availibility online!  I'm not exactly sure what's up with it, but it has absolutely NO taste whatsoever......very big disappointment :o(",4
3403,"if u compare to buying the 3 packs at walmart, its a great price. 4 of the 3 packs from walmart are $26+, this is $15  the flavor is the best ive ever had. i like spearmint but then a friend gave me a piece of this and its way better",4
3410,"This product is very good, but what with the $79.00 price plus paying for shipping.  I was ordering this product for $30.00 for a pack of 12 boxes and shipping was free  I was told a few months ago the cookies would no longer be made. I get an e-mail that they are in stock again, well that's nice but not at the $79.00 price I can get them a lot less expensive at my local grocery store.",4
3413,Bought this because our new son-in-law loves it and they could not find it in stores anywhere. He was thrilled.,4
3414,I use Agave Nectar for my Margaritas so I have this on 'Subscribe and Save' which is a great option. It comes to me automatically just when I need it at a discounted price. It was damaged only one time out of 4 shipments and it was re-shipped in time for my needs. You can't beat this price anywhere. Love it!,4
3423,"At my local Costco store, I bought Pace salsa numerous times. The salsa tastes feel rich and I love the jalepenos Pace puts in the salsa. Spicy, but not too the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy my salsa and chips.  The salsa doesn't feel watered down and this is a great ""go to"" salsa choice.",4
3426,"Although they are a bit expensive, every now and then these candies are worth considering. I wish they sold them in the states because they are so unique in both taste and texture.",4
3428,"I've been a customer of Right Foods for almost 8 years, but the Asian Entrees don't do it for me.  They taste bitter, and the seasoning is inconsistent.",4
3438,"When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00.",4
3441,"I had never purchased Beef Jerky or Beef Sticks through an on line vendor, prior to placing an order with Choo Choo R. Snacks. The products arrived on time and in good shape.  They were great. The peperoni sticks lasted about 4 days.  The big bag of jerky, about 6.  I had heard several customers complain about the jerky being tough.  When I was growing up, some 50 yearsw ago, jerked meat WAS TOUGH, chewy, but tough.  Bufflo Bills' Hickory smoked jerky was delicious.  They sent along a packof Teriaki (SP), flavored jerky.  Wow, that was soooo good!  I have placed another order with Choo Choo R Snacks.  I will buy all my Jerky, Beef Sticks, etc from Choo Choo.  They do these products right!",4
3443,"We thoroughly enjoyed the taste of this rice. The grains were long and smelt excellent. On top, this is organically grown rice so free from chemicals and pesticides. Will buy this rice again :)",4
3449,"Because my job involves talking all day, and I am constantly surrounded by allergins, I go through cough drops like mad. The way I see it, if you are going to consume something, you might as well enjoy it. Ambrosoli-HoneeEnergy Plus more than fills the bill. I found it to be very soothing, but also had a strong honey flavor that I absolutely LOVED!  The very best review I can offer for this product: I am about to order it again, and will be back for more.",4
3453,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",4
3456,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old.  I wish I had found them earlier.  They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient!  I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about.  They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.  The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together.  They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies.  You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.  Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8.  That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)",4
3461,I buy these with subscribe and save.  I like the flavor and aroma.  Going on month two and I am not tired of them yet!,4
3462,"Best buy for your money, smaller boxes of this item is just too expensive.  Lasts for months with no complaints,.",4
3463,"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable.",4
3466,My son gobbled this down right away.  I was looking for different flavors since they only hold so many in the stores.  Texture is fine.  What else can I say?  Tastes good to me too!,4
3470,"Like many other reviewers, I first found these apple chips at Costco, who has since discontinued them.  If I'd known they were going to be discontinued, I would have stocked up because they were about 50% cheaper!  But still the Amazon price is a good deal for such a large quantity of dried apples.  I eat them as a snack (I keep a bag at the office for this purpose) and I also use them as treats for my pet bunny (he goes absolutely bonkers for them). The quality is great; I haven't found a single seed or inedible piece in the four bags I've gone through so far.  Plus they are organic, which I do not normally care about but becomes important if you are ingesting any quantity of peels. Definitely recommend!!",4
3478,I purchased this product because I like to have a little protein in me before my morning walk. It is delicious.,4
3479,"I really like these crackers and I'm thrilled that Amazon offers this product. I'm a Bariatric patient and it's always hard to find a crunchy treat that is healthy.  I save a ton of money too because buying individual boxes was getting quite pricey for me since I eat at least 2 crackers each day.  I've tried all 3 flavors that Amazon offers; they all are quite tasty, but this one is my all-time favorite.",4
3481,I had had a very hard time trying to find Quaker Banana Bread Oatmeal.  I was quite excited when I found it at Amazon.  The service was excellent. The price was right.  I am delighted to have my oatmeal again.,4

3483,"The quality of the almonds is so much better than my local supermarkets. I just started eating raw almonds, and I didn't think I would be able to tell the difference between suppliers. Besides the great quality, the pricing is good, too.",4
3488,"Surprisingly tasty and a great texture.  I was excited to find these in my local grocery store in the Passover section.  My expectations were low, but these delicious crackers made me a believer!",4
3497,We use these popcorn packs for our party rental business. We can keep enough in stock. They are easy for our customers to use and taste great!,4
3508,"When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's.  Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste. Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered. It was from the Post people, perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past.... One could only hope.  It the parking lot of the Grocery, I cracked open the box to give it a taste. Instantly I was transported back to my childhood, munching on cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons, the road runner, bugs bunny, it all came back...  I had found the 'holy Grail' of cereals.... ok, maybe that's taking it too far, but man its really good. So good, I subscribed for auto ship every month.",4
3515,I was a little nervous about this product when it was first introduced to me at a support group meeting.  I wasn't sure how any GF product cooked in the microwave could be edible.  But it was delicious.  I now try to keep some on hand for when traveling so I have a food option when the rest of the family is taking advantage of the hotel breakfast since almost everywhere has a microwave they'll let me use.,4
3522,"I actually have tried four flavors (to date) of the Di Vinci syrups.  I like them all.  I use them in baking (you can find some recipes on the internet for using these syrups in things like muffins, etc).  Be aware that these syrups are made with Splenda.  We love Splenda - use it everyday, so we're ok with it.  (Some folks have a problem with it, though).  Currently, in my pantry, I have strawberry (I suggest using this over some low-fat frozen yogurt or ice cream!) vanilla, peanut butter and pancake syrup.  All four taste great!  The consistency of the pancake syrup is thinner than you might want, however.  I bought it because my local store did not have syrup made with Splenda at the time.  (Now they do, though).  The price listed here is good.  I've paid $17 per bottle at an online retailer!!",4
3525,I remembered this from when I was a kid. I hoped it was as good as I remembered. It was!! This is great. If you like honey and cinnamon you can't miss.,4
3533,This was my first time ordering from this company. They're fast and a great product. Will def be ordering more flavorings in the future.,4
3538,"Very closely resembles a Triscuit cracker...except there is no soy!  (And a bit lighter.)  You will not be disappointed with the taste and texture, it is a quality cracker.  Enjoy.",4
3548,"We can no longer find these baked Guiltless Courmet in our area stores, so I am delighted to be able to buy them in bulk at a terrific savings from Amazon.  They were shipped very quickly, and were intact and delicious.",4
3555,Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best I've ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs.,4
3557,"This was the first product from Amy's that I tried, and I like it.  It doesn't taste like regular chili, but I think that it has a good taste to it.  The sodium content is quite high, though, so check that out if your watching your sodium intake.  I think that it's a little too expensive, but I'll probably buy it again if it goes on sale.",4
3559,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor.",4
3563,"Good choice for healthy protein, satisfying and delicious. Interesting sweet and spicy taste! Portable protein for on the go energy!",4
3564,"These pretzels are almost addictive they are so good.  At $24 for the 12-pack they are a bargain as well, beating the local grocery stores.",4
3565,I bought these because I didn't get the almond balls. These coconut nut butter balls tastes much better. My kid likes it too.,4
3583,"I eat this cereal almost every morning.  It has a great taste and texture.  I have been gluten- free for 7 months now and this is my favorite cereal.  I know that this is marketed for kids, but as I am 39 yrs old, I can truly say that adults live this cereal too.",4
3584,"This is an extremely tasty seaweed snack.  The biggest plus to this product however, is the fact that it is roasted with Olive Oil.  Most commercial seaweed snacks are roasted in rancid, unhealthy canola oil or soybean oil.  So the only option for health conscious people was to buy the raw nori sheets and roast them ourselves, which is fine but a bit of a pain.  Kudos to SeaSnax for stepping in and filling the void.  The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product.  Hopefully others will get in on the act and competition will drive the price a bit.  Also, there is no real ""Amazon"" discount vs buying at Whole Foods, but not everybody lives near a WF and not all WF's stock this product.",4
3586,"Simply put, this stock has more flavour than most of the other options. It will add depth to your soups and sauces. If the flavour is too strong you can thin it down with a little water.  As a bonus, it is consistently well priced on Amazon and you don't have lug it from the grocery store.",4
3595,This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One may purchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz. The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar and forget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to  help me when confronted with the facts so poor customer service.,4
3600,These are MUCH cheaper at walmart... 2.50 a canister. You are basically paying double. You would think it woudl be cheaper on amazon then at walmart. WAY over priced!,4
3601,my 4yr old son loves these as well as all the children I babysit! Hard to find where I live so I will continue to purchase thru amazon...even set up auto delivery! great price and fast shipping,4
3606,I ordered this jerky because it was the best price per pound and I had never had Brown Sugar Jerky.  It was surprisingly good.  The jerky was not too dry and didn't have an overly sweet taste.  I would recommend this as an option on road trips or as a snack that increases your daily protein intake.  I have even added this to Amazon's program that automatically sends it to you each month.  I definitely got my money's worth.,4
3611,"These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!",4
3613,The picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but I was only sent one but was charged for three. Also the item sent was not the item shown. I can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store. I went to Amazon because I was looking for the type shown.  When I contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping. Seeing as how I was shipped something I didn't order I should be entitled to a full refund including shipping. I was not offered that.  If I could give this seller negative stars I would. Any future buyers beware.,4
3623,"These nuts are a delicious and healthy snack, compared to other things I might snack on. They are individually packaged which is extremely handy for school and work.",4
3632,My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again,4
3633,"Our favorite coffee, and what a great price..However, the delivery we set up cannot be relied on.  some months it arrives as planned, some months it does not show up, then we get a msg saying out of product...then it comes the next month....hoping they resolve the availability soon",4
3634,Sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible.  USE CAUTION before buying this item since there are NO RETURNS and you might find yourself with a throw away.,4
3635,"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone.",4
3637,"this is first time trying Ambrosia Pure Honey from Colorado's W Slope, and my first implosion is great for the taste and price. However, I feel the honey is not really pure since the consistency is not as I expected when I purchased it. Overall, I like the taste and the kids do too.",4
3646,This bag is extremely over priced. I can buy this at Winco for 99 cents when it is on sale. Just wanted my fellow amazonians to get the best price.,4
3648,"For whatever reason, my local grocer does not carry Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I was happy to find it here on Amazon.  The bags of cereal in this box are nice and large!  This has lasted about as long as 4 regular boxes of cereal, and we still have some left.  I was skeptical about buying cereal this way, but it turned out to be a pretty good deal after all!",4
3653,This product is a great organic version of tuna helper.  My family loves it and it tastes great!,4
3654,"This product exceeded expectation, makes you feel better after drinking.  Will buy again.  Thank you Dr. Oz for talking about it on your show!",4
3655,We can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher.  I absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor.  I will continue to purchase these crackers from Amazon to complement any holiday.,4
3673,"I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.",4
3678,"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME.",4
3689,We love this cereal!  One of my daughters eats this every morning for breakfast.  I like that it doesn't get soggy so quickly.  I have even used this to make gluten free rice crispie treats!  We subscribe to this and a case arrives every month- at a price you can't beat!,4
3693,Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!,4
3694,"These were the best, and somehow fresher-tasting, that we have enjoyed, yet!  A good buy!",4
3696,My wife makes a shepard pie with this & the wholesome taste is so good.,4
3699,"Definitely the way to go when you buy the base unit.  Grasses last a long time if you give good light and sufficient water.  I wouldn't buy this without the base to save money though, because the wooden base keeps the grass tray from moving and tipping over when kitties munch on it. Good quality, great value!",4
3700,"Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product.",4
3709,It is really good and delicious! I would buy it again and recommend it. Really tasty. Thank you. Good product!,4
3717,"I'm new to tofu, newly vegan, and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores. I was hesitant to purchase in bulk, but am so glad I did. I purchased both the soft and the firm versions, and it has been great in every recipe! I will definitely be ordering again!",4
3723,"I just have to say that I agree with the first reviewer.  I really had a good experience with this product.  I was buying it for a friend, it came very quickly, the product is unique, and it is something that everyone can use.  The customer service was outstanding.",4
3729,"I was hesitant to purchase this, despite the outstanding reviews, because of the price. I mean, what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed?  With that perspective, I was very pleased with these meals/snacks. The rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places (possibly even better than the rice in my house) and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable.  If you like sushi wraps and rice, I highly recommend you try these.",4
3732,I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!,4
3735,"I have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it's all about price. Kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though, so, always a good place to start.  Since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something I eat every day I really don't find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next. This Kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with *important consideration* for comparisons being fair, i.e of the same color+grade. I did not find this to be thinner than other brands either.  Great on pancakes, waffles, crepes, aebleskiver. I've also recently started experimenting with using maple syrup instead of sugar in for certain recipes as it is a more pure, less processed form of sweetening.  Pleased with this product and recommended.",4
3736,"This gift package surprised me when it arrived.  The little cutting board was the perfect size for its intended use.  The food products were of very good quality and just the perfect portions for a great snack time. I was very happy to give this as a gift to a relative who has everything, but enjoys good food.  It arrived in quickly and in perfect condition.",4
3738,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.,4
3739,"although a bit too sweet, i like the texture and the amount of choclately goodness in each bite  :) i do wish the brownie was a bit larger, but i like the automatic portion control, and the fact that they make a convenient snack for work or school.  usually amazon has great prices on food items, but in this case they are half the price at your local costco. (where i was told by an associate there that they fly off the shelf)!",4
3743,"I love Amazon!  I ordered this on Tuesday for my weekend baking and we received it on Thursday.  Best price around and delivered right to the door.  Easy peasy!  The can was a bit dented on the bottom, but the contents were not affected.",4
3744,I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agree,4
3745,"My son loves the Gerber breakfast buddies, so I purchased an 8 pack of each flavor. I love them because they are very convenient and still nutritious. However, local stores sell these for $.20 less than Amazon.",4
3747,"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.   My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs of the tender beef spinach. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too? For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",4
3748,"I love these bars!  This is a smaller company producing an EXTREMELY high quality product.  You get what you pay for, I'm glad to pay for such a great product and will continue to purchase these.  Thank you for such an outstanding product!",4
3754,"These crackers are delicious, and healthy.  My 17-month old daughter eats them equally as well as the popular graham cracker brand.  I will definitely buy these again.",4
3755,I like the fact that this capuccino is not that sweet. The taste is really good. I give it four stars because I like the Amaretto one even more...,4
3756,"I purchase several types of snacks for my hubby and I but find this product to be one of our favorites. It has lots of sesame sticks, which we love. Also the idea that four packages are included in the price is a good buy. I would definitely buy again.",4
3757,"For years I've enjoyed Swedish pancakes served with lingonberry syrup at The Original Pancake House, and even at a few House of Pancakes (though theirs aren't as good).  I discovered the lingonberry preserves at IKEA, and then found these identical ones on Amazon.  They are absolutely wonderful on toast, waffles, pancakes. The seller packaged them extremely well with lots of air-filled material and each jar separately wrapped in paper.  Great job!",4
3758,"I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that weren't had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality.",4
3764,"This sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing...so I ordered some.  We had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter.  To us, it is dreadful.  It has the texture of paste and not even palatable...for us.  Am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save.  When you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal, I'm sorry I was fooled by these flavors.",4
3771,I tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage.  The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute.  It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom.  The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.,4
3772,I can't recommend this company enough.  I always receive my Pepsie's within two days.  The price is far less than I pay for it here. Plus I get it delivered to my door.,4
3776,"I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.  Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.  It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.  It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,  If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.  Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were. If this is of concern to you, contact mfgr. to ask about glass jar options.  EDIT: Feb 2010 - I should add that I buy direct from Really Raw. Their price includes shipping within the continental US - FYI",4
3777,"Some pieces were kinda hard to chew, but overall I love this jerky. Taste is great. Price seems good considering it's dried salmon.",4
3780,Each of the gummies are in indiviually wrapped bags.. like one. they fit perfectly in my favor bags for my wedding would for sure get these again in the future. really adorable.,4
3781,"Bought this to put in party favor bags.  Price was great, item arrived quickly, and fruit snacks tasted great.  Would definitely order again.",4
3785,"Not sure about how these are priced, as I bought them originally at the dollar tree for... $1, but it was a package of only 8 oz, not the 15 oz available here on Amazon.  The cookies were such a surprise, especially coming from the $ store! They were so good I wanted to eat the whole box.  They are super tasty with coffee, like biscotti, but more melt in your mouth.  Not too sweet, not too bland, just right.  Loved them.",4
3796,These were as I remember them. Totally yummy.  They came quickly. They were well packaged with mylar bubble wrap and a small ice pack to keep them fresh.. Ordering anything from this shop is safe and worry free. Thank you.,4
3801,Not much you can say about coconut syrup other than it tastes good. Item arrived in a timely manner and have no complaints at all to make.,4
3805,"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did.",4
3808,Easy to make--great organic maple sugar and oats--fantastic flavor.  Even my teenage daughter loves this single serving Oatmeal and enjoys it also as a snack after school.,4
3815,"These are really good, but its a stretch to pay that much for them.  I would buy them more often if the price was lower.  Energ brand is more resonably priced.",4
3819,"This purchased was well package, arrived undamaged and in a timely manner. The product was the best solid white albacore tuna I have ever had. It was much better than the name brands in my local markets. I have already placed a second order. I highly recommend this product.",4
3823,I have 3 kids and we love this product.  Even friends who come over request it.  It is really yummy!,4
3824,"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.  The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.  Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.",4
3835,This is an excellent product but unfortunately its not eligible for super saver shipping so the cost is too much per tart,4
3837,"These are excellent. I was worried they would taste too natural and not really like a cookie, kind of like the difference between Kashi cereal and normal cereal but they taste like any high quality Choc chip cookie and have the added benifit of being a little bit more healthy. Easier to justify than a pack of oreo's... All in all a excellent product that arrived in perfect condition and I have a active once a month subscription for them, for the last 3 months.",4
3844,We have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these!  Unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest.,4
3846,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!",4
3857,This is the best popcorn ever.  I wish all stores sold it but so far I have found it only on Amazon and some Wal Mart stores.  I would rather buy it from Amazon of course.  It tastes great and is also just the right amount to watch a movie at home or to share with a partner.,4
3861,This tastes great.  I have shared it with several people and they love it.,4
3862,"I was happy to see that I could purchase this on Amazon. Previously had to go to our local health food store. Price is about the same, more convenient to come to the house. High protein, low fat, tasty and give a energy boost on intense bike rides or anytime snack when you don't want a carb rush! :)",4
3867,"Very fresh and tasty!  Will buy again soon. Since I ordered it in Dec, shipping is a little later then estimate, better order it earlier.",4
3872,"A friend of mine has suggested ""Leilalove French Macaron"" to me. It is realllllly awesome. If you are a ""Cookie Lover"" it worth testing. Plus, beautiful package and on time delivery.",4
3873,"During a recent trip to Ireland, I got to try Muesli.  I had no idea what it was when I first had it, but then when I got back to the states I was so disappointed that I couldn't find anything like what I had.  Then my friend said she found some in the grocery store, and it was this!  It is almost exactly the same, no added preservatives, sweeteners, or anything.  It's all natural deliciousness, and I found that buying it here saves about $10 over the supermarket.  I highly recommend it.",4
3882,I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.,4
3883,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced.  With a little research you can buy this for less than half the price.  Buyer beware",4
3884,Great carbonated beverage. My son gets it at school and loves it.  I can't find in local stores so I bought it here. Kids love it.,4
3887,"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again.",4
3891,"Purchased these for my husband who loves to use maple syrup in his oatmeal.  They are small, but nice, and by the time you've used one up, don't need to worry about sticky buildup.  These would be great for taking on trips or camping.  There are 3 of them and they are encased in opaque plastic and pour very well.  We love the quality of the flavor.  Good maple syrup is pricey these days, yet I think the cost in comparison to other high quality syrups is competitive.  I would purchase again.",4
3895,"Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor. They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct. I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it. What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is. Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again. Yes, this review seems harsh; but I rarely take the time to do this. The only reason I have, is so you don't waste your money. Regards to all: Ron",4
3897,I bought this product for my son who is in grad school. He said Emeril's K-cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far. I will definitely buy them for him again.,4
3898,This is a great cereal.  I could not find it for over a year.  I was on Amazon and just happen to search for the item and they had it.  I am so happy I can still buy this product.,4
3901,"Have others noted how overpriced the grocery items are? Even factoring what you would pay with tax, this is just not a good deal. I can purchase Annie's mac and cheese for 1.19 at my local grocery store. This price works out to 1.57 a box. What gives with the high prices???",4
3909,"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller.",4
3911,Comes vacuum packed in a foil package (inside wooden box).  Flavor is excellent and really couldn't be better.,4
3917,I found this once in a store but they don't carry it any more. I am so thankful that Amazon.com carrys it. My son says it's his favorite meal.,4
3926,One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.,4
3927,I eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method.  The nutrition provided is high quality. I recommend all the Erin cookies for a snack or meal.,4
3931,My children love this cereal. The price is great (I can't do much better with a coupon and Sam's can't touch it). The cereal arrives fresh and in great condition. It's awesome that I don't have to run to the store with all four kids in tow when we start to run low! Thanks Amazon!,4
3939,this plant appears to be dead on arrival.... ive had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well 20.00 for a dead weed... no thanks they wouldnt let me submit this review with out clicking a star... not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine...i have three,4
3940,"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them.",4
3944,"Just canceled my order.  Found the same product at Target for $2.99 with an instant coupon, got it for $2.50.",4

3949,"I am not much on stuff like this, but having some issued that I think this item will take care of, I got some here - local shops did not carry it, prices at flea markets and food shops were - just to high. The price from Amazon was very good. I no longer have need of this item - but if the condition returns - so will I, HERE!",4
3954,"The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didn't even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine.",4
3958,It tastes really good but is the price wrong $5.16 each!!?? You can get the for a dollar each on sale at Vons....,4
3959,Received 3 boxes.  1 box was shy one squeeze pack.  Daughter was EXTREMELY angry when she did inventory.  Otherwise she's happy.  Will be more cautious/reactive if it happens again.,4
3960,"I am very dissapointed in Amazon on this one. Anything that I buy on a consistent basis I buy through Amazon, whether it is electronics, books, toys, diapers, etc., Amazon always comes through with an unbelievable deal. On this product they have missed the boat badly. I can understand 10% higher than the store, I can live with that. I'll buy in bulk through Amazon just for convienence. However, this product can be purchased an any Target or major grocery chain (mine at least - Kroger) for $3.89 or 4.29. If I were to buy 6 of these 32oz concetrates at Target with tax it would run me close to $26. This is 33% less than the sale price that Amazon is offering. This is the same concentrate used by starbucks, this is why I use it, to save money by making it on my own. Unfortunately with the price point I would be better off having someone make it for me.",4
3962,"Yuban is one of the best coffees available, but not sold in all areas. Amazon's case price is unbeatable!!  I get a case every 8 weeks, always on time!!",4
3969,I bought these to make homemade peanut butter.  It turned out wonderfully.  My 15 month old daughter loves it on her waffles.,4
3972,"This is the best inexpensive coffee I've ever bought!  You can certainly compare it to higher end brands.  And when I subscribe I get it even cheaper. How can you go wrong?  Overall, I love this coffee!!!",4
3973,I ordered three bags of these with a past order. All I can say is yum. I did not compare prices too much but this product tasted better and fresher than any I have found in local markets.,4
3974,I checked with my vet after purchasing these online for my cats and the difference in price is $10 cheaper on Amazon than at the vet's office!  Great deal!!,4
3977,I was skeptical of buying this soup at first but it by far surpassed my expectations. It tastes soooo good!,4
3991,"Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating. The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.",4
3992,"This product is just as expected.  I'm new to making my own sushi so I have no experience prior to buying this product. I've made many Spicy Tuna Rolls and the nori has yet to break on me.  I'm not sure if it's because I have practically mastered the art of sushi (not really) or just gotten lucky and not rolled the sushi too tightly.  Either way this was a great buy, shipping didn't take long at all.  Had the nori by the end of the week.  Would buy again",4
3994,"dear amazon.com Please keep this on subscribe and save forever. this is a great cereal for health. not the best tasting in the world but this is a powerhouse of nutrition, at a great price with subscribe and save! thanks amazon, sincerly loyal customer forever. P.S. will be purchasing more.",4
4003,"This is the second time my wife and I order these from Amazon. They are extremely hard to find and the one place that sold them, no longer carries them. They taste great, honestly the best mints available. I will continue to order these from Amazon.",4
4008,"Very Very overpriced. 30 Starbucks K-Cup for $49.44? You can get from BJS, Sams Club or Costco a 54 count Starbucks K-Cup for $39.99. Which is a way better deal.",4
4009,"My wife became spoiled when we were on a fall trip with the taste of light maple syrup. It is not available in the south, so she was very happy to find it from Amazon.com. Hidden Springs is very high quality and have fast shipping. Thank You.",4
4011,"This was handy when I couldn't get to a store and wanted some for the coming week...3rd day it was here, not bad price but looking for better price but this was good stuff. :)",4
4018,I USED TO PURCHASE THESE AT MY LOCAL WAL-MART BUT THEY DO NOT CARRY THEM ANYMORE AND WHEN I LOOKED AT OTHER STORES THEY WERE SOOOO EXPENSIVE. I DECIDED TO CHECK ONLINE AND WAS ABLE TO ORDER THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND RECEIVED THEM PRETTY QUICK. NOW I AM A HAPPY AND CONTENT CUSTOMER,4
4019,"Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product.",4
4023,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money.",4
4026,im deployed in kuwait and ordered this for our cookouts we have every now and then. arrived fairly fast in about 2 weeks( about average for mail to kuwait) it has really improved the quality our our steaks. i love this stuff,4
4031,"I've been eating Boboli for years. What can I say? It's really the perfect pizza crust. Not too fluffy, not too flat. Great taste, great price. I like this much better than the ""crust in a can"" varieties. Boboli's been around for years now for a very good reason...they gave us a great product that has withstood the test of time and at a reasonable price to boot. I usually brush mine with melted butter with a hint of garlic for added tastiness. Pile on the Boboli sauce, a ton of cheese and your favorite toppings and you have a home run for the whole family. Highest recommendations.",4
4037,Ordered these after receiving my new k-cup machine.  Taste great after finding the correct serving size.  Quick service and good price.  Definitely ordering more!,4
4040,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",4
4045,"If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth.",4
4048,I received this product in record time.  I tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked.  Love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase. I would recommend to all my friends.,4
4052,"I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The ""cheese"" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware.",4
4054,This buckwheat is tasteless compared to Russian buckwheat. Only good thing is that it is organic. Will not order again.,4
4055,"The rice is a fine rice, but the price is awfully high.  I can buy a 20 lb bag of this for $24, and a 40 lb. bag for $42 at a local store.",4
4064,I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand.,4
4066,"I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess.",4
4067,"I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so-called ""all-natural"" product. I have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me, so that is the only flavor I can vouch for right now.  About halfway down the list of ingredients you'll see ""yeast extract."" Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and ""natural"" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google ""MSG yeast extract"" for yourself, or check out [...].",4
4074,I was a bit skeptical on ordering a Spirulina bar.  It is soooo green.  I must say it is one of my favorites to eat before going to the gym.  Not grainy nor too sweet. It gives me just enough energy to work hard without exhaustion.  The small size is just right so no need to save half for another time.  It is an excellent edition to a raw diet.,4
4078,"The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, ""Well, what do you want me to do?""  ""Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???""  Amazon has lost my business forever.",4
4079,"OMG, THIS WAS $19.00 FOR 3 BOXES AND I JUST BOUGHT IT FOR LESS THEN $2.00 A BOX, IF I WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AT WEIS MARKETS I WOULD HAVE NEVER PAID THIS PRICE.

4080,"This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal.",4

4084,"Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.

4096,"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good.

I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased.",4
4103,"I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz. container, and I assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $8.",4
4104,"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme. Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting. Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.  In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky.",4
4107,"Instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans, I received a cardboard box, with a plastic bag full of jelly beans.  They were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag.  On the box there was a typed label that said:""green apple jelly  belly 16 oz. new"".  There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience.",4
4116,The taste of the onions in this first jar is not up to the standards I've come to expect with my many jars that I have purchased through the years.,4
4124,"We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house, and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don't over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice, fluffy fruit-filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate.",4
4126,"Bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals, and have been waiting for them to be in stock here. I'll definitely buy more when they are available, as they are the best shortbread cookies I've ever had, my son agrees, and I love that they're basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself, with ingredients you can pronounce and won't kill you. :)  SO delicious!!!",4
4129,We use a lot of Organic Maple Syrup and this was a brand recommended and Amazon Subscribe and Save had the best per ounce price!  I love not having to think about stocking up on items I buy all the time!,4
4135,"A word of caution to anyone considering buying these: Read the ingredients first! I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.",4
4139,Excellent customer service and I received the item sooner than expected. Price was lower than in stores.,4
4142,This item shipped quickly and looked nice but it fell apart after about two weeks.  Look elsewhere for a komboloi.,4
4143,"Everyone in my house loves these cookies, even my sister who is not into ""healthy foods""",4
4144,"I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products.",4
4145,I love that my son is learning to feed himself with these healthy snacks that he loves!,4
4148,The caraway seeds are a really good value. I did encounter a problem with the time it took for the order to arrive. I bake for a farmers market and was depending on receiving the seeds on the date that I was given. Apparently there was a problem with the bags and had they just let me know I would have not kept expecting them. I finally contacted Amazon concerning my order and was then advised of the delay. I would order these caraway seeds again as they are fresh and well packed to stay that way.I hope I never have to resort to buying them in the grocery store again.,4
4152,Product was clean and in a good package.  As I could not find this item locally I looked to Amazon.  Price seemed a touch high except I have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair.  In any event I was glad to get it anyway.  I purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items.  These people seem to take care of their products.,4
4155,the gaint slim jims taste so much better if you keep them in the refrig for some reason & make great snacks on the run...,4
4160,"This shipped very fast to my base in Afghanistan. Was a fresh treat, the crackers are lightly salted and the amount of cheese is a nice amount. Yummy and healthy at the same time",4
4162,"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!",4
4165,"I rarely find this product in the grocery store in my rural town so I decided to make the online purchase.  Kraft Honey Hickory Smoke Barbecue Sauce is a mild, sweet sauce - nothing fancy but I really like it.",4
4171,we searched everywhere to find this jerky.  It is the best on the market and they ship very quickly.  We had it in less than 3 days. We have already reordered it.,4
4172,I've been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon.,4
4182,Package was received at expected time. More importantly the walnuts are fresh- of good size- and excellent flavor. No preservatives such as BHT which some other companies use.,4
4186,"This is for 4 six pack boxes. You can get these boxes for 6.99 at Target, so this price is over $10 more. My bad for not checking the local price beforehand. I won't make that mistake again!",4
4188,"Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters¬Æ Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated ""for your protection"" according to the company's hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com!",4
4189,These are very good!  I love to munch on them for a crunchy snack.  And they dissolve quick enough for my 17 month old to eat (most of) them.,4
4190,"First, you can either soak or spray this product.  If you're lazy like I am you can put it in a spray bottle, spray your produce in a colander in the sink, and rinse a bit later. I've never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way (with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples & the wax turns whiter & starts to chip off).  When I've used the soak method, I've seen the dirty water after, so I do feel like this does a nice cleaning job.  I love this stuff and many grocery chains don't carry it reliably, so it's great that Amazon has it!",4
4194,"These are really good and healthy. Use the ""Subscribe & Save"" option because you can always have them skip a shipment (or cancel whenever). Watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly. I paid 9.51 for mine (including shipping with ""Subscribe & Save"").",4
4196,"This is a great product and my daughter loves them. She's been eating them since she was 9 months old. However, this is extremely overpriced. They're $2 a pack at Publix. $6.24 a pack is nuts.",4
4197,Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. It is not a stock image.  I created it and put my website name on it...LooneyStuff.com...for use on my website. I have asked them to take my image down from this listing.,4
4200,This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!,4
4204,almost the best home brewed coffee i have ever had and the price is great much less expensive than the grocery store i highly reccomend it if your into coffee,4
4205,"I have been eating this for years but it is hard to find in the regular grocery stores so I purchased it over the web.  It is great for a fast, tasty meal.  We add bite sized chicken breast to it and it is plenty for 2-3 people.",4
4206,"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough.",4
4209,"Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese. It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)  The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.  The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired. I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..  Will shy away from this product.",4
4215,"I only received one box of seven packs of snack packs for $14.99.  Usually I receive 6 boxes of seven packs for this price so 42 total packs, not 7.  I should have been more wary.",4
4221,I sent this case of soup to my son. Great deal and I know he has food for now,4
4223,"Very reasonable price for an outstanding product. Checked many other retailers locally and online. I can honestly say without a doubt, that I received the best value for the 20 pack coconut bars!",4
4232,"I am so happy I finally found these on here. To the person who gave a 1 star because they are 10$- you may be able to go in a store and pay 2.59 a box. If your like the rest of us who are from NY, NJ, etc and moved to the west coast- you cant find these anywhere. I usually stock up on these when i go back to NY but its nice to know I can order them whenever I want!",4
4234,I usually use Hellmann and bought this and will be purchasing it again.  My family and I really like it.,4
4236,Ordered 2 both had bent tracks and I actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. But you get what you pay for....,4
4244,"These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right ""kick"",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.  Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price.",4
4250,"I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner.  Newman's Own¬Æ Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 7-Pound Bag Very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. Extremely pleased with their customer service! THANKS AMAZON!",4
4253,"I received this Bonomo turkish taffy assorted 4 flavors it was tasty not too sweet but perfect flavors too.I shared mine with my family my son he really liked it kept asking for more,and I also took some to my parents house my brother and his family were there too that day so are my sister and her family they all ate some and liked it too ,told me where I bought it my son and my daughter told them amazon she is at their website every day looking what amazon has new stuff so she can grab some and share with everyone they were looking at me with their smile on their face so they said amazon website is your second home you are there all the time I said sure I don't want to miss a great deals.",4
4254,"These peppercorns were visibly of much better quality than we'd gotten other places before, and the aroma was tantalizing before we even opened the package!  They arrived fresher than I've ever tasted peppercorns in my life, and the seller is very professional and quick with shipment.  Highly recommended!",4
4256,"I love the taste of this tea. It didn't induce my labor (only walking seemed to get the ball rolling), and of course I can't tell you if it 'toned' any of my lady parts, but I had a very quick smooth labor so maybe it did something. I am now 7 weeks postpartum and I'm about to order more just bc I like the taste of it. I enjoy this one much better than the Milk Maid. Super Satisfied!!",4
4265,"For those who love herring you won't find a better product. I remember eating kippers as a child and loving them,  grocery stores have a limited selection and higher prices. These are much better than I remembered. Absolutely fantastic and good for you. Inexpensive source of omega-3 and the fish are renewable!!! I am so glad I found them here..",4
4268,"These graham crackers  are everything you'd want and expect of an all natural graham cracker.  They taste great with and fit right in with our family who go through a box a graham crackers on any given week.  These weren't quite as ""tough"" as our usual brand of grahams with a few more broken crackers and they definitely don't stay fresh up as on the counter if you forget to seal up the zip lock.  I think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and I don't think they really detract from the product at all.  They are great crackers and worth the space in the pantry!",4
4273,These are a great snack.  They are filling and healthy for you.  My 3 year old even loves them.,4
4275,"This is by far the best product on the market. I have purchased this item several times and have never been disappointed. One time my Lab got to the package before me and he enjoyed it as well, but seemed to prefer the cherry the most. Hawaiian Shaved Ice Syrup is awsome. Its number one at my house for the kids and sometimes my dog.",4
4276,I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).,4
4280,"They used to carry a large jar of this at a local store, but I never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened. It is delicious with brie on a cracker (though I found out I am allergic to dairy so no more for me!) but it can also be used as a glaze, eaten on french bread, toast or in spoonfuls from the jar! I love this stuff. I only wish it came in a big tub that would last you the rest of your life.",4
4284,"I was skeptical when i first purchased this because i got it pretty cheap and i'm used to buying pretty pricey stuff at the store.  But it's actually pretty good! I will definately keep on purchasing this, saves me quite a bit of money. Also, stays very fresh when kept in the freezer",4
4286,This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.,4
4290,This is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices.  We always keep a can in the refrigerator.,4
4292,Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago.  The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming. I generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product.  I would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others.,4
4296,"I have enjoyed many PR's up to 30-40 dollars a pound and have a very good sense of quality. This is about an 18 month as stated. It is on the mild side which is quite special in itself. It has a fresh wonderful buttery taste of a fresh PR. There is individual merit for the various ages up to 36 months. I personally do not like the 36 months variety.  This is a bargain and to be well appreciated.  Pay the next day during the hot months.  Mt second order 2 weeks later was not fresh, dried out not the young freshness and tenderness of a 18 month - did not taste good. Why!?  We really like these cheese. The third shipment was perfect.",4
4299,90 percent of this candy and these brands are still sold in stores today!You could pay 30 dollars at the grocery store and probably get 4 times as much candy for the money.,4
4309,The Bonzai I ordered came well before the estimated date...  however... the tree I got as a gift was TINY. Nothing like it looks like in the product picture.,4
4316,I bought this product as a gift for my son who is away at college. He liked the tea and enjoyed having a varity to pick from. I will re-order this again. Two thumbs up!,4
4317,"Great product!  I purchased this product from our local Fresh Market. I am a vegan and am always looking for different ""meat"" substitutes to try. I used this mix to make some taco mince. This stuff was perfect! I even got my non veg. father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well. That right there is saying something, because my father is really iffy about mock meats.  I have another packet in which I am going to cook up today!",4
4318,"Becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them, they expire quick. I can't use these, I ordered them to use in my November wedding but they expire in March :(",4
4321,"The product is so versatile and flavorful. I use it to make instant ginger tea, also to cook Asian style dishes or bake delicious cookies. I trust Frontier, they always carry high quality products, non irradiated and sulfur-free.",4
4327,This product is really delicious. I use it for stir fries since I am no longer interested in meat. Quick and handy to have. Will continue to buy.[...],4

4331,This is very good quality foil.  I can't find a difference between this recycled and 100% virgin.,4
4332,Skippy peanut butter is a product consumed in my home quite frequently. Good product at a reasonable cost delivered free to my home - a good deal!,4
4336,This is item is on my regular grocery list.  They have a good texture and are tasty.  I only wish they were organic.,4
4348,"I bought this brand without having tried it beforehand because I couldn't find any mulling spices in bags in the local grocery stores last month, and I was ready for some apple juice and mulling spices.  It tastes very good, much the same as another brand a friend shared with me last year.  I have tried other instant brands but didn't care for them.  These are perfect for me, although the amount I had to buy here on amazon was really more than what I wanted.",4
