952,The basis of my diet is using the Zesty Italian with little or no oil and I still get that great taste.

1174,I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!
3180,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
