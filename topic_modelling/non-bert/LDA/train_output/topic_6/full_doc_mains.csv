0,Disappointed.  The big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes.  I am not sure why but not good.,2
19,"Had a box of their garlic sticks, and really enjoyed the quality and satisfying feeling from eating them. Wanted to try a new flavor, and the sesame is quite addicting!! Only 2 Weight Watchers points for 4 incredible sticks. These are made in Italy. Expect many of the breadsticks to be broken, but don't let this stop you from trying this premium brand!",2
32,"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product.",2
34,"This sauce has a unique flavor and a decent kick. I like a very hot sauce and this is not as strong as my usual choice. It does, however, have a very unique flavor that I enjoyed. I have used it on a number of dishes and was really impressed with the way it jazzed up my homemade vegetable soup. I will be buying this again.",2
43,"These tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes, which is great! They are also very flavorful. I've been using them in a coconut curry and I don't even bother soaking them to soften them, I just throw 5 of them (five halves) in the vita-mix with everything but the coconut milk, blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk. Delicious! I originally purchased these because I had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that (the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they aren't organic) but 3 pounds is still so much I gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks I'm weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once I give him the coconut curry recipe he'll be thanking me.  Oh, and the bags zip lock shut after they're opened, which is a nice touch.",2
51,"Bought these to try some new recipies, but have found they are quite tasty straight out of the can, chopped up in my salad!",2
58,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt.  A little bit goes a long way!  I don't usually cook with it, but add it to things afterwards. I've been hand grinding it.",2

68,"I'm of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.  1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an ""instant buckwheat""  2. It tastes quite different than ""usual""  3. There is a strong metallic smell  4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper.",2
73,I personally love this cereal and i know it maybe too plain for some but you have the option of being creative with this.helps me keep calories in check.,2
89,I bought this to make a sauce and it taste great gives a good flavor.  I really enjoyed it an it lasts a long time.,2
91,"I am not a health nut and I had to keep an open mind with this product... but once I tried it it actually tasted really good. Just a tip, don't eat it by itself (not good). Try it with smoked salmon and cream cheese or make an avocado and turkey sandwich. Also toasting it for a few minutes will soften it a bit.",2
93,"Lately I've been trying about 20 or more sauces to find just the right one that balances flavor and burn.  But, to put this into perspective, I really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that.  This sauce is not really that hot, but the taste is awesome.  It definately has heat, but doesn't really have much burn.  In short; if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice.  In fact I'm browsing the internet to see about ordering a case.  (for those days when I don't want my food to have the last highly pronounced word if you follow my meaning.)",2
96,"I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesn't have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World.",2
101,"I was very impressed with the quality of the vanilla beans I received. Not only were they at least 60% less expensive than the beans in grocery/specialty stores, but the beans were plump and very flavorful. I also received my order very quickly (sooner than the seller stated). I will definitely be back to buy my next batch of vanilla beans here.",2
108,"i love this butter. it's better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great. Plus it's organic with higher levels of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). A must in every home, i think",2
114,"I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!  Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended.",2
118,"I am a tuna snob!  This tuna is close in quality to the best tuna I have had and works well for making large qauntities when the best tuna is cost prohibitive.  I mix with cannelini beans, olive oil (generous amount) and chopped red onions for a great meal with greens or bread or both!",2

130,"Happy with this purchase, it's a good deal. It's the most fragrant coriander ever! Coriander is a super spice, tri-dosha (and a health supplement as well, research it, it's a ground cilantro seed). We use it in lots of dishes. Thank you!",2
131,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW  Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?  Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!  The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.  ~ Ana Mardoll",2
132,"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.",2
136,"Oil is very pleasant to the palate Fruity with a distint olive taste, which is what I was looking for. Excellent product. Far superior to any Italian EVO I have tried.",2
152,"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}  I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.  This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review.",2
164,"We were pleasantly surprised at how good these tasted.  The %DV for sodium is 15, so while not excessive, we limit ourselves to ""one at a time.""",2
171,"This Chipotle Sauce is very tasty, and it can be used with many different things. However I loved it the most with vegetarian meat (I'm a vegetarian, living healthy and all *grins*), and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich, or with cooked vegetarian meat. However this sauce is very fattening, hence why I took one star out, it contains 11 grams of fat in 2 tbsp. So one needs to be careful to have it in very small portions, or make sure to have a good workout session after indulging in a good hearty meal containing this sauce.  Overall I love this Chipotle sauce, very tasty.",2
174,These bean are wonderful. They are very moist and smell amazing!I started making a batch of homemade vanilla extract and the color is already a dark amber; only after a few days! Will definetly buy again!!!!,2
177,This stuff is great to make egg dishes special.  It does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt.,2
189,"This is a tasty G.F. product. I've been on a G.F. diet for 7 years so have tried a lot of different products and this is one I reorder. My only negative would be that it doesn't reheat well, but that's true of most G.F. pastas. Not a problem if more than one person is eating it. Nice to have some thing quick and easy to make that is still a hot meal and G.F.",2
202,"I was not expecting much from this, a disposable package of self-boiling pasta with a bag of meat sauce. There should be no way it can work. But it does! You fill cover the slightly oily pasta with water, leave on the drainer top, microwave it for 3 minutes, drain it, heat the sauce, and mix it all up. And amazingly, it tasted good! Normally I can't stand this zero-effort lazy style of cooking microwaved meals, but this was actually really tasty. I would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price, but I can imagine people who would.  I have to take issue with the packaging, though. I am giving this four stars because each serving is individually packaged, and none of it is recycleable. The bulk of what you are buying is packaging, and it all gets thrown away.",2

219,"I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]  And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...",2
255,"This Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is quite enjoyable and has the tangy yet not very spicy taste you would expect. I have used it on burritos and as a dip. There is no question that if you like the flavor of Chipotle sauce you will enjoy this. But it is high in calories which I expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor.  Yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. And even so, I would get this product again.",2
257,"This is a great tasting hot drink. It is not chocolate base like Milo or ovaltine. When added to milk the color of the milk barely changes. It gives the milk a smooth texture and a creamy taste. I mix 2 tbs with warm milk, sometimes I use sugar and sometime I don't. Without sugar added it still has a good taste.

258,"This is genius!  I purchase Angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine! The product is AMAZING! Don't get fooled by all these negative reviews!  If you like Asian food, you probably already know that their pasta doesn't taste like American/European kind. it has a different texture and taste. So these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at Big Bowl :)  The comments about the smell are ridiculous! How many raw uncooked food smells good? Are you kidding me? For instance, I love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming! :)  PLEASE follow the instructions: rinse in cold water for at least 15 seconds and boil for one minute, dry in paper towels. if you don't follow instructions, you will ruin ANY food, even your most favorite!  Since the pasta is 0 calories, I finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce ( no low fat anymore ) or some seafood Alfredo! the possibilities are endless. Please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors.  Absolutely delicious and guilt free!",2

280,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.  For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.  As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.  I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.",2
281,"In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste.  Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)  There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.  But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. This has become a cooking essential in my kitchen.",2

305,"My husband and I have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy, which is why I purchased this product. I was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using, and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat. Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's "" smoke point "". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect.

Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.  Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.  The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.",2

456,"The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.  I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.  Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt.",2
457,"I recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn. I was surprised this was so tasty! It has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor, that's not too overpowering. This makes it easty to create a flavorful, savory snack without the extra calories. (As compared to potato chips or cheese crackers, for instance.) I hope to try the other flavors really soon.",2
464,"Love this Sauce. Taste is perfect, I use this Sauce with so many food but mostly with macaroni cheese so Go for it. Best Sauce...!!!",2
468,"This product is good for any dish, I like to just cut it out and eat like snack but remember to go with nice wine or else it will be taste funny in your mouth.  It also good for cooking with lettuce, boil or pan fried the lettuce first then add on this product and make a oyster sauce topping, it will be delicious.",2
469,"These are the best quick-boil udons I've ever had. The noodles are just right and the soup is pretty good. You can also skip the soup base and add your own stuff. I like adding tofu and tempura fish balls with my udon. If you're fortunate enough to have a 99 Ranch Market or Nijiya Market nearby, save yourself some money and buy the udon there since they're sold for only 79 cents a pack.",2
470,"Taste fantastic!  Somewhat hot if you consume a lot of it at once, but nothing to be fearful of.  It's the perfect hand-made taste hot sauce to replace your over-the-counter Cholula/Tapatio for all of you meal choices.",2
486,"The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).",2

527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.",2

It tastes fresh, has the right amount of sugar, and brings a subtle pleasantness along with it. The design is pretty cool, and my purchase supported an independent label. I highly recommend this product and am sure that I will continue to purchase it.",2

566,"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches.",2
573,"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best.",2
574,"Nice smoky taste, which I like. I am having a hard time eating enough protein, so I thought this might help. It is soft (as commented on in other reviews), not the traditional pull with your teeth kind of jerky. I will be making a few concoctions with it - chopped in a bean salad, and crumbled on a baked potato.  Thanks Amazon for the gold box special so that I could try it.",2

This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so. edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.  I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna. I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.",2
633,"You can add ground turkey to this and it tastes wonderful! I wasn't a big ground turkey fan until I tried it with this mix. If you don't have ground turkey, you can boil a chicken breast with skin in the 7 cups of water, then discard the bone and skin and add the mix. I've made it both ways and they're both good. I also tried it with ground beef but like it with turkey the best.",2
639,I bought these thinking they would be a handy emergency meal but found that they have a great taste.  I have tried adding a little hot sauce and a little Worcestershire sauce. Wow. Even better. The 8 oz cans are very convenient. I recommend these to anyone wanting something smaller than the usual 15-16 oz can.,2
653,"I had been making my own homemade taco seasoning, but it is time consuming.  Being health-conscious, I didn't want to purchase any more products that contained ingredients I couldn't pronounce.  I am glad I found this taco seasoning as we cook taco/burrito meat generally about once each week, if not more.  Organic is best and the taste is wonderful.",2

658,"First I ordered a case of Loma Linda Vege-Burger.  It was disappointing--a whoooole case of disappointing.  I thought that my memories from youth of how good canned vegeburger had been must have been overblown.  Then I tried this Worthington Vegetarian Burger.  This is exactly what I remembered.  The big problem is I can't stop eating it.  I love eating it straight out of the can!  The texture is great, the flavor is great, it crumbles nicely--easy to use.  Calories are moderate as well.  Good imitation meats help me resist eating the real thing, and this product is perfect for me.",2

I read the good reviews for this Annie's product. I wanted to get the subscription to save money, but 12 packets was too many to buy, when I didn't even know if I would like it.  I went to Walmarts and was lucky to get a packet, they didn't have many. I just compared the prices, in Walmart it costs $1.62 a box. On Amazon with the subscription, a box costs $1.23, that's a big saving.  I made it yesterday, and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar, after it was cooked, then put it under the grill to melt the cheese. I was going to eat half and heat the rest up today, it was quite a lot for one person. It tasted so good, I ended eating all of it! If you like mature cheddar you'll probably like this. It is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it. It tastes almost as good as the reat thing.  I ordered it on subscription yesterday, I can't wait to try it again.",2

685,"With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely. I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly. All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.  3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.  I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.",2

It says so right on the label.  I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles"".",2

I was at once concerned, however, based on the weak aroma at first opening. And, these initial concerns were confirmed at first use... little flavor here.

Beef Rub: Brown sugar, sea salt, paprika, chille, rosemary, fresh garlic, chipotle powder, cumin, and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Chicken Rub: Brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chille, McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning, curry, garlic, cinnamon, and Chinese Five Spices.",2

Really, it is not ""hot"" spicy at all to me but does taste good.  The pack I ate was filled with lots of smaller pieces and only a few slices.  I didn't find it overly dry, just kind of moist and chewy.  Great high protein snack for low carbers and anyone else.  Less than 1 gram of carb per serving, 60 calories per serving and 2 servings per bag.  But you'll probably eat the whole bag because it's not that much!  Enjoy!",2
766,This dressing is awesome! It's very tasty and not so full of chemical ingredients as other dressings. We wish we would have discovered it earlier.,2
779,Simply put these packets are easy to use and yield a good result when you want Indian in a pinch. I modified the recipe on the packet by adding chopped onion and some leftover roasted potatoes making the result more of a complete meal.  The salt content is a little high but overall the quality is excellent for a concentrate.,2
782,Love this stuff. I bought it cause it was cheap but it tastes great. It actually comes from India and the ingredients on the package are all things I can pronounce and recognize. I've been eating indian food for a long time and this was my first successful attempt to make it at home. Love it.,2

It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting.  I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand.  Though the kernals popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand.  I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!",2
805,"I am pretty happy with this product.  It has a good taste, the peanut is clear and not burnt, and like the low sodium in it.  I don't miss sugar in it, pulling all that other stuff out brings the peanut flavor forward.  My one negative is that it's not as silky as I'd like, maybe just a tad too low on oil.",2
807,"Sustainably caught off the California Coast, packaged as disclosed in a previous review. I feel a tad guilty buying 10 at at time at the local co-op but they are simply the best tasting sardines, distinctive and flavorful.

The grinder was a pain in the wrist to use. I'm so glad that Weber now sells it pre-ground in a shake-on container. Plus, the grill-lid shaped cap is a cute touch. I definitely recommend this seasoning as it's just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal-grilled steak. I'd even use it on chicken or pork, as well.",2

875,"I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.  I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.",2
876,"I should have listened to the negative reviews, but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. There was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto I made. I agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. Not worth even this price for truffles.",2
881,I've already reordered this item twice. I like the taste of it. It has the right amount of spice and can be used to make veg briyani if your not very fond of chicken(I tried both). One of the best products from KoI. Recommended,2

923,"I love Taco Bell so I knew I would love this sauce.  I have used it on chicken, veggies, baked potatoes and most recently, I put it on my mashed potatoes.  You can use this in many ways, salads, meats etc. The taste is creamy, rich and spicy but not too spicy.  it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos, then you will like this.  I am not a big fan of alot of spices and when I cook, I really cook plain but I do like this product.  It's not too much and not too little.  If you want to add a little zest to your every day meals, this is a good way to go. *************************************  THIS IS AN UPDATE, 2 WEEKS LATER Ok, for me, this sauce is not too spicy, however, I served it 2 times to company.  One time I used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time, I used it for a topping on taco night in my house.  Both times, my friends and family said it was too spicy for them.  I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.  So, if you like spice but not heat, this is a great sauce. There are many, many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish.  However, it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it..but it tastes great.",2
924,"These low fat rice crackers have just the right amount of wasabi heat. Fast service, great vender. Individual servings stay fresh until needed.",2
927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.",2
933,This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.,2
950,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago.  I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.  FANTASTIC!!!",2
977,"This soup is a staple in England, with its creamy texture and sweet tomato flavor it makes an excellent meal alone, or you can dunk bread in it, or grate some cheese in before heating - any way you eat it, it won't disappoint. It has the added benefit of having no artificial colors, preservatives or flavors in it.",2
978,This is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn.  I use it in everything. I no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has.  You will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef.  Buy a non-corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again.,2
979,"I bought this salt on a lark because I didn't want to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that carried natural sea salt but I will buy it again.  The flavor is wonderful.  I'm not a big salt eater, never have been, just don't like the taste of commercial salt but this sea salt is wonderful.  I real winner that enhances the flavor of food instead of covering it up as regular salt does.",2

993,I already loved Raisin Bran but this is even better.  I love the almonds and there are crunch bits that stay that way through the whole bowl.  The flavor is the same Raisin Bran that I love with a little cinnamon flavor boost and extra crunch.  I think it is awesome.,2
1004,"These instant potato flakes taste great and do not contain sulfites like many commercial brands.  I do wish they included some simple instructions on the bag.

Remove from heat and add 1/4C cold milk or soymilk.  Add approximately 2/3C of potato flakes (more or less depending on how stiff you like them).  Stir gently and fluff with a fork.  Do not whip.",2
1009,All of the Mrs. Dash marinates are wonderful.  They're quick and delicious.  We initially tried them for their health benefits... but the flavor is why we continue to buy them.  I highly recommend every flavor!,2
1012,These little links are great. Very healthy and delicious. Great shelf-stable non-meat protein source! I'm not even a vegetarian and I prefer the taste of these over meat sausages.,2
1026,I would say this is the best tasting popcorn  have eaten.  It to me is better than movie thearte popcorn.  It has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor,2
1032,"This sauce is awesome.  I went on a month long quest for the next best table hot sauce.  I read a million reviews from different hot sauce sites only to order product after product and finding it flavorless, under-powered, over-powered, or simply disgusting.  This is THE most versatile hot sauce out there.  It makes a fantastic table sauce as well as an excellent marinade for some wings.  It showcases the cayenne and garlic without making the cayenne or garlic so much that it's unwelcome.  It is an immediate medium burn and should satisfy anyone seeking a nice well rounded table sauce.  BTW:  These independent hot sauce reviews (non-Amazon) were hard to go through.  A lot of them are video reviews.  Why do people reviewing hot sauce think we want to see them eating hot sauce on a cracker over a crappy webcam.  And then they review the sauce while continuing to munch on a mouthful of hot cracker.  Gross...",2
1037,"Bought this in spite of the high price and unreasonble S&H, just to match what I make at home. I mix it with fresh ground hemp seed. I buy the almonds (in the shell) at [...], soak the nuts and grind them in my VitaMix... Beats peanut butter to hell and back.",2
1044,These glazed walnuts are always fresh and Amazon has the best price on them.  I use them in a salad I make and they are always a hit.  Joe,2
1055,"I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!",2
1058,"I put this on some basically a chicken fajita and was not bad. Like Taco Bell's other sauces, this one does recreate a Taco Bell type taste which may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective.  I still like Taco Bell's Spicy Ranchero sauce better.  Despite being Jalapeno, this is not a very spicy product.",2
1068,"This tea is really tasty and at a great price.I'll be ordering more,that's for sure.Since I really don't have anything else to say,but this stupid thing won't allow me just to keep it simple,I have to add words to make it over twenty.Hope you're not as irked by this as I am.",2
1073,"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods.",2
1085,"This flour is very fresh tasting and consistent in quality.  When I order anything from Bob's Red Mill, I know I am getting the best available product.",2
1133,"This is a wonderful product, and I am not one who dines at Taco Bell. I used to eat there when I was younger in college, but have not in years, so I was pleased to try this product and find that it was great!  First, I like that the bottle is not so huge because the taste will stay fresh instead of getting stale from lack of use. I have many dressings and toppings etc. in my 'fridge, so it's nice to have a smaller bottle.  Second, the taste is excellent. I love the creamy texture, and it has just a little ""heat"" from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot.  I used this on a home made taco salad, but I also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish I made that was like a south of the border spaghetti - grandchildren like noodles, so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a Mexican style noodle dinner that they loved!  So I highly recommend this product!",2
1147,Pleasant fresh tasting coconut. Smells good when you open the bag and smells good a week later when I finish it.,2
1166,Was pleasantly surprised.  They are very good and I don't miss the salt at all. Would always have to rinse off the salt but no longer.,2
1168,"I don't know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad I did.  I made it per directions, just adding water and a can of tomato paste.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't tell my SO there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome.  Couldn't believe the very low calories and high fiber.  A definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry!",2
1178,"I bought two jars of this cayenne pepper for my grandpa, who uses cayenne pepper to make a squirrel-repellant blend of bird seed.  Works just as well as the overpriced retail brands from the supermarket.  This is the best price for bulk cayenne pepper I've seen, and it shipped exceptionally quickly.",2
1179,"I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it's just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it's very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it.",2
1182,These taste great.  I add 1 or 2 cubes to the water when cooking quinoa or lentils and it really adds a nice depth of flavor.  I use them often.,2
1185,"Only good use for these would be: In case of poisoning, use to induce vomiting!",2
1190,This is another in a series of good Kashi cereals.  I have yet to have a bad one.,2
1199,"The small can in which the olive oil is stored are very handy and does perserve the fresh flavor of this very good oil. The quality of this oil is high enough to use it as a dipping sauce, especially when mixed with fresh herbs.",2
1204,"Good quality product, but you would have to REAlly love curry flavor to like these... They are so awful I don't know what to do with them, but I know I won't be eating them.... I'll stick to the plain sea salt ones:)",2
1213,"My wife introduced me to these - we bought them at the Japanese store in Epcot.  After we'd eaten the two we bought, I wanted to find them on the web, so I was pleased to see you could get them at Amazon.  This is a tasty noodle dish.  It's not what I first thought - a soup.  It is really noodles, with a spicy mustard, mayo, soy sauce mix.  It's easy to prepare as well - the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water.  The container is pretty neat too - a built in strainer that lets you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls.  It's a little expensive if you just want ramen noodles - it's much more exotic IMO.  Try it!",2
1222,"Drew's makes some fantastic dressings.  Their Italian dressing, for example, is amazing, especially when dipped with bread.  I was pretty confident this would be a great dressing and I was not disappointed.  I made a salad with crispy wontons, red onion, toasted almond slivers, mandarin oranges and a couple of tomatoes and then put this dressing on top -- WOW.  It was a great salad.

1224,"On a whim because I was out of salad dressing I decided to give this a try.  Being calorie free and sugar free I didn't hold much hope for this.  But I can say that it is incredible!!  I use it in tuna, on salads, salmon, and as a marinate with some balsamic vinegar. I love to really ""dress"" my salads, so now I can do it guilt free!",2
1226,We cannot believe how flavorful this Kraft Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce tastes.  I used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped!  It's not too spicy for us and I assume it's because of the brown sugar.  You can't go wrong with buying a product from Kraft Foods.,2
1242,"This is an aromatic and tasty oil, great on salads or for scrambled eggs. I'm sure I'll find more uses for this as time goes on!  Free shipping makes it a great deal.  My only nit pick is the lid.  Two of the three bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open.",2
1246,"Actually typed in ""smoked paprika"". This showed up so I ordered it and it is definatly NOT smoked!  Also, these bottles sell for 4.95 at Sam's. So, not only was it the wrong item but, I over paid also!",2
1247,"these are not DOP they're just ""certified"" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write ""department certified"". real dop tomatoes are much better.",2
1257,"This cheese had a great smoked flavor, not over powering as some can be. It worked very well with must of my grilled recipes.",2
1260,"The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)",2
1280,"I just ordered these vanilla caramels, along with a bag of the sea salt kind.  Although I am more partial to the sea salt AvenueSweets caramels, these are also great - very fresh, soft and chewy, with a hint of vanilla.",2
1293,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess.",2
1332,"Purchase from the commissary! Perfect snack size, the combination of the crackers and tuna make very balance protein to carb ratio and total calories are under my 250 calorie per meal (eat small meals every 3 hours). Taste is spicey and yummy without a ""sauce"". I tried a different BRAND and it had a sauce in the tuna,yuck. Not this! I also used this to make tuna cakes and did not have to add ANY seasoning!  They were such a hit I had to go buy a case from the commissary to share with the ladies group!! Hoping Amazon will get it so that I can order it as an automatic subscription. Even my hubbie that is not a seafood person, loves it.",2
1345,"I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste ""disgusting"" and the texture ""too much like meat.""  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price.",2
1348,A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.,2
1349,"I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.  To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.  One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.",2
1380,"I regularly order this soy milk product and use it with granola cereal. It is great by itself as well. Be sure to serve chilled. It has a strong vanilla flavor, which I like. I keep thinking that I'm going to get tired of it, but it still tastes great each and every carton.",2
1384,"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!",2
1395,Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months,2
1397,"I didn't know what to expect since I have never used a pre-cooked cornmeal before, but I made delicious polenta with it! The polenta was creamy and smooth and delicious, with a very mild nutty corn flavor,and the next day it had hardened and I slices it and fried it in a little butter and it was delicious!  My first go at arepas was not so successful, but I think that I am to blame, and not the product!My only complaint is that it is hard to find recipes that use it.",2

1417,Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn't just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed.,2
1420,"Use it in casseroles, stews, soups and rubs for your meat.  Use it everywhere except your coffee.  So glad I bought it.  It's fantastic.",2
1437,"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!",2
1438,"Flax Plus is proof that heathy cereal does not have to taste like treebark.  I am diabetic, so I wanted a cereal that provided low carbs, low fat, fiber, and one that tasted good.

1445,We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.,2
1459,"As other reviews have said, this tastes pretty good. It's the best dried garlic I've tried. Mine came in the three-pack and I hope I use up the other two before they go stale.

1475,"These are Wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy granola bars.  They taste pretty good. They're not listed as organic, but it seems like they should make them that way since they're free of so many other things. Some of the ingredients are listed as organic, but not all.  They taste good. There are 9grams of sugar per each bar just FYI.  For anyone wondering about the ingredients for allergies or food sensitivities, here they are in order:  - Gluten-Free Oats - Organic Agave - Rice Blend (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthan Gum) - Coconut Sugar - Raisins - Monounsaturated Safflower Oil - Organic Eggs - Walnuts - Coconut - Chia Seeds - Natural Vanilla Flavor, - Sices - Baking Soda - Sea Salt - Xanthan Gum - Grainless & Aluminum Free Baking Powder (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate, Potato Starch)",2

1493,"I bought this product due to my obsession with Malai Kofta, and also the high reviews.  I was not disappointed.  There is great flavor in the product and it filled me up for dinner.  The potato dumpling/balls were a little hard but I had boiled the pouch, so maybe next time I will pour the whole packet out and heat it up that way.  Highly recommended, it is the next best thing when you are too lazy to head to the Indian restaurant 20 miles away!",2
1494,I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking.,2
1498,"We first tried this sauce in Costa Rica on vacation. When we ran out of what we had brought home with us I was so glad to find it on amazon. This bottle is huge and will last quite a while. This sauce is really good, it has a kind of smokey, spicy flavor.",2

I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels.

If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products.",2

1544,"I now have to lower soduim intake and this does the trick!  It tastes great and you do not miss the salt.  I usually eat with reduced fat or sodium cheese and enjoy every bite!  Even the family is liking it, the variety does proove difficult to find though.  Wish Amazon carried it regularly.",2
1551,"Nice mild taste though there is a strong fish odor in the 'juice' - the cats loved that! there are a lot of bones and skin - reminds me of when mom would make sardine sandwiches... very tasty though and no after taste. and though no salt is great, I'm going to try the no bones or skin type next...wild caught is great too",2
1556,"I eat lentils at least once a week if not more and these are the best I've ever had.  Typically, I just buy the pound bag of goya or store-brand lentils which are serviceable, but every once in a while I'll order these from amazon.  They really have much more taste than the generic pound bag of lentils.  They take longer to cook, but are definitely worth it.  Highly recommended",2
1561,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.",2
1562,"I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again.",2
1564,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).  While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.  While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.  Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.  If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.",2

I could eat this dish every day!",2
1590,"I used to use the other popular brand that cost 3 times more.  This brand is better at 1/3 the price.  This product has a very rich pink color.

Very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart, brain, hair, joints. I use regular coconut oil for cooking. Some people complain about it separating, which is true, but I use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle. Then it is easy to take a spoonful. You could gently heat it (in a pot of hot water) and then mix it up but I never heat it. I prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using, but I am happy it is Organic.",2

It tastes great and satisfies me on every level.  I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands.  I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving.  Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions.",2
1610,"This product,though expensive along with the shipping, is the best tasting non-instant I've tasted.  Add a little vanilla and sugar and it's very drinkable.

Be careful not to over-cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart, still tasty though. The soup I make calls for sauteed carrots, celery, & onion. Add ham or sausage if you wish. 1 garlic clove, oregano, salt (if you haven't added salty ham), and optional hot pepper flakes. It is very hardy and filling. Caution: Lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle.",2

Or just the noodles with some chopped green onion to dress them up. Or with a little curry powder. I've tried Top Ramen in the past but prefer Maruchan.",2

So good for snacking and adding to yogurt and on cereal.  I have not used them yet in baking but plan to make some muffins with adding the cherries to the batter.  Taste, for me, is the right balance between tart and sweet.  After opening, I put the cerries in zip lock bags and placed them in the refrigerator.  The cherries are fresh.",2
1670,I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time.,2
1672,"Although there were several ""shriveled"" ones, they taste just fine.

1677,If you like Graham crackers and you like oats and honey then you will love this product.  Just the right amount of each makes this a real treat to eat.  I only wish it had less sodium (130 mg).  Apart from that the lack of trans fat and saturated fat makes this a healthy choice for graham cracker lovers.  I would buy this whole grain product again.,2
1678,"This is very tasty!  It is a great item to have around for company.  Pull out some crackers, put some cream cheese (or even havarti or edam work well), and then top it off with this yummy jam.  It is hard to find where I live.",2
1679,"Great culinary cooking. Got it with a lavender cook book and have been impressing my friends with the gentle, subtle flavor of the lavender. A little goes a long way and there is a lot of lavender here so it can easily be used for all sorts of dishes. Makes a great way (with a little sugar) to brighten up a lavender Margarita -rim the glass with the crushed lavender instead of salt.",2
1683,"With no extra salt, it tastes a lot like fresh corn.  You can add the salt after if that is to your taste.  Everybody's will be different.",2
1684,"I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.  Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.  Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.",2
1696,Great taste and great quality. Smells wonderful. I saved my store bought container and re-used it for these. Grinds so easy in my pepper grinder!,2
1707,"had never tasted these before buying them on amazon. did my research and amazon had the  best price. now that i have tasted it, i have to say it is delicious and made our bbq an even bigger hit! will continue to buy this brand!",2
1711,"My review is for the Cinnamon cookie in the small bag.  I love them!!!  I do not have gluten issues, but I like the fact that the cookies are gluten free.  They are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet.  Only 130 caloriesand 4.5 g of fat in three cookies.  Each pack has 4 cookies.  1.5 g of saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 0 cholesterol, 180 mg sodium, 1 g fiber, 21 g of carbs, and 2 g of protein.  Yummy, every bite.  Starbucks carries them sporadically, and I am so glad to be able to buy them from  Amazon!",2
1715,A must for anyone who loves to cook.  This sauce along with the Raspberry Chipotle are so tasty and add a nice twist to spice up otherwise boring chicken and steak. Also makes a nice and cost effective gift.,2
1716,"We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy.",2
1717,I haven't tried other crystallized ginger to compare but I have a hard time not sneaking a piece here & there til the can is mostly empty.  I expected more of a dried product but this is delightful.,2
1721,These beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans!,2
1723,"I am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch, with all fresh ingredients, but I really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork.  This has not only nice flavors, but a bit of thickening.  I use it whenever I make split pea soup (one packet of this per 1lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas...beautiful, thick split pea soup every time!) or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored.  I don't add salt when I use this but other herbs can be used, of course, with fantastic results.  This comes in several other flavors now, but this is the one that I use the most.  Just store the packets in airtight containers, such as Lock & Lock, and they keep practically forever.",2
1724,This salt works great in my grinder and is yummy. I had no problems with the package; all the salt was contained. A great price for the amount of salt. I'm quite pleased.,2
1740,"I love these tasty snacks.  They have a great crunch and just the right amount of salt.  I am not sure I would call these a ""health food"" because of the fat content, but they are really good tasting, and I will be ordering again.",2
1744,"These noodles are great I was stationed in Kuwait and had everyone eating them. I'm in dallas now, where can I find them?",2
1756,Length:: 1:00 Mins   These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!,2
1765,This is a large amount of crystalized ginger and I don't think you could beat the price. I would have preferred it to be a bit more sweet to offset the heat of the ginger but it's still good.,2
1766,"I bought this product for my research lab, and all the other grad students loved them... They are not just for kids. This product tastes good with an excellent texture that is not too gummy.  Also, as a bonus, they are decently healthy with no hydrogenated oils and protein to boot!!!!  I honestly could care less about nutrition but our lab nutritionist gave them the thumbs up.",2
1772,"I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.  Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition. However, the taste was totally bland. It is commendable that they used less salt. However, they could have added a little rosemary and/or garlic, for example, and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium. I also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery, as were the pasta curls that they think are ""noodles"".  Yesterday I had a can of Progresso Classics Vegatable that was the same calories, more nutricious, and full of flavor. Even the old fashioned small can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle is a better bowl of soup than this. No more ""Healthy Choice"" in our pantry.",2
1783,I was hugely disappointed with this product. The Walden Farms line of 0 calorie salad dressings are great. This alfredo sauce is not. Do not waste your money on it!,2
1796,"THis is the cheapest price I could find for citric acid. I use it to make detergent, so I needed a big bag. This was the right price, good quality and it got here fast. Highly recommend!",2
1802,These are excellent quality flaxseeds! I just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack! I also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too :) Delicious + Nutritious = Awesome! :))) Planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies. I think I will also try out Bob's Quinoa and Museli.,2
1814,"This curry powder has a nice well-blended flavor.  And, it is hot without being too hot. It adds a nice variety to many of my dishes, espeically fried rice which I eat quite often.",2
1818,"The only thing you're missing by eating this instead of wheat pasta is the carbs. It's got a really great light taste, the the bag makes a deceivingly large amount of cooked pasta.",2
1828,"I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!",2
1833,I like this mixture very much.  It could be less expensive but for taste and quality it is worth the price.,2
1840,"Item taste wonderful, is easy to use and is a great price.  Gave one to my sister who has alergies to regular soy sauce.",2
1841,OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.,2
1848,"I am always looking for something to take to the office to have for lunch.  I enjoy items that are different and have flavor.  This item was a pleasant surprise.  There was just enough Citrus flavor and spice to make this simple dish a nice treat for lunch.  I do wish the ingredients were listed before purchasing.  I am a vegetarian, preferring to be vegan.  This item does contain milk.  If you are a Vegan, then this item is one to overlook.  I do recommend adding a little brocolli, carrots, peas, or pea pods with this dish.",2
1854,"The first thing I look for in a water is the aftertaste.  Some of them have a metallic, nasty taste that I can not stand!  But this one is very refreshing.  Cool, Clear and Fresh!  Definately would buy again!",2
1855,"They arent too salt and vinegary, but still have the flavor of it.  Very good tasting.  Crispy.",2
1856,"Hemp foods are great, the slightly nutty taste is always something I enjoy. I almost rated this item four stars because it doesn't have a strong hemp seed taste - but after some thought it is probably best that way.  I add a bit of brown sugar and one packet will fill me up (not true with most other oatmeals).",2
1863,like eating soft plastic . we pored them in a big pile in the back yard under the trees. the squeals wont eat them!,2
1874,"The taste is really good - I do love coconut, but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower. It helps with my heartburn as well.",2
1879,I like this so much that I use it in most of the foods that need a pork flavor. I have even used it in home made baked beans.,2
1889,"Very happy with these beans - they're very fresh, very fragrant, and arrived quickly.  I used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as Christmas gifts:  I split all the beans lengthwise, and added them to a 750 mL bottle of vodka, shaking about once per week for several months.  To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.  The flavor is excellent, and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store.  Also, I put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister (leave them out to dry first!) for yummy vanilla sugar.  Highly recommended.",2
1893,Just had a can of these and wanted to confirm the great quality of this product. Excellent taste and three big sardines barely fitting into the can. I'll get more ...,2
1900,"This product was recommended to a group of us ladies by a cardiologist who spoke at one of our meetings.  She said her patients were getting fantastic results taking this to help them lower their cholesterol (LDL levels).  My LDL needs to be lowered by 20 points and I don't want to take medication.  So, I decided to give this a try.  I have taken it for two months but it will be a few more months before I have my cholesterol level checked.  At that time, I will know if this works.  In addition to taking this, I've been eating steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and have cut way back on beef.",2
1912,"So... I usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta.  It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!",2
1918,An excellent product that holds up well.  Not soggy and very tasty.  These rice noodles are especially wonderful in soup.  On the box there is a terrific recipe I immediately tried.  My husband and I loved it.,2
1936,"This sauce, with lobster added, was the hit of the night! Paired with pasta and garlic bread, my family couldn't stop raving about it.  I managed to save one jar for myself.",2
1943,i was having problems finding good reasonably priced beans out of season...here they are!,2
1957,I have had martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives in the past and these are tasteless in comparison.  I could not distinguish the taste of bleu cheese.  Take the time and stuff your pitted olives with fresh bleu cheese or find another already prepared brand.,2
1961,These are great tasting.  It's like a mix of raisin bran and honey bunches of oats.  I did the subscribe and save and it really does save you money.,2
1970,"I love the sauce with steak.  I haven't tried using it with anything suggested on the bottle yet.  With a nice Filet, though, delicious!!!",2
1987,"We just love this mustard!  Excellent flavor!  Great deal on Amazon.  The subscribe and save plan from Amazon is great & you can cancel & change your plan anytime you want.  It is well worth it.  Organic!  Only one bad thing about it, it's in plastic.  If it was in glass (like Eden) then wooo weee!  Simply perfect!  I have a awesome recipe you can try out using this mustard.  I was thinking that a pack of 6 might seem like too much mustard for most.  But if you try this delicious recipe, you might find that 6 aren't enough!  Roasted Potatoes Dijion  1/2 C Dijion Mustard 1/2 C Olive Oil 3 Lbs Red Potatoes, Cut into 1 1/2"" pcs. 2 Med Red Onions, sliced (aprox. 1.5 C) Chopped Parsely for garnish (if you don't have fresh parsely it rocks without it!)  In a small bowl, combine mustard & oil. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onions, and the mustard mixture.  Toss to coat well. Spread evenly on a baking sheet. Bake at 400F for 45-50 min. or until potatoes are tender and crispy. Garnish with chopped parsley.  Yum!  Enjoy! :o)",2
2002,"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)  Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!",2
2007,"Love this stuff. I use it for everything. Awesome in the kitchen (especially in brownies!), great in the bathroom for a hair mask. I buy this all the time!",2
2009,"I really like this soup and I'm typically not a big vegetable soup eater. The one thing I want to mention is that in the ingredients, I believe ""Yeast Extract"" is just another name for MSG.",2
2023,"Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on.",2
2025,"I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2-pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly. They taste great on their own, but I usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile, or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture. My supply is almost gone so I'll definitely be ordering more.  One of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but I didn't find any in mine.",2
2044,"I love them. They go really well with soups, salads, etc. I just wish that they don't come broken up so much.",2
2045,Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. Make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad...and this type of fish with omega 3's is good for you.,2
2047,This is a great quality olive oil with a slightly grassy overtone to the flavor. It's obviously a bit more expensive than your average everyday supermarket olive oil; but it is well worth the money.,2
2051,"I've ordered this cereal twice so far from Amazon.  I can find it at our local health market but it costs more locally than buying a three pack from Amazon.  The 'Best By' dates are always good (this last pack had 13 months from purchase).  My family really enjoys the taste, though it doesn't taste like Kelloggs Raisin Bran.  Peace one cup serving has 190 calories; 2g fat; 170mg sodium; 44g total carbs; 8g dietary fiber; 9g sugar; 6g protein.  Kellogs one cup has same calories; 1g fat; 210mg sodium; 46g total carbs; 7g dietary fiber; 18g sugar; 5g protein. This may not be for everyone, but I love a raisin bran cereal and knowing Peace has half the sugar makes me love it even more.",2
2053,"I've been trying with limited amounts of success to eat vegan and low-gi. Amys soups are excellent for this, they make it very easy to lose weight. One limiting factor is fat cravings, eating vegan it's actually hard to get enough fat.  This is a long way of saying this soup tastes great, I can tell it's oily and i love that about it. I need fat in my diet or I'll lose my mind and eat a whole pizza. Low-fat diets are a travesty anyway, creating a market for high-sugar high-gi products labeled as ""healthy""  So this soup brings oil and mushrooms and a very good flavor. I've had about a dozen types of amys soups, and this is at the top with golden lentil, no chicken noodle, and trader joes lentil vegetable (made by amys).",2
2069,"I have purchased the Zoe evoo in cans (regular and organic) many times in the past and been very satisfied.  I like this Zoe 100% arbequina evoo even better, as far as taste goes.  It is very flavorful, somewhat grassy with no bitter taste, and has a smooth, silky texture.  It is more of a rich yellow color than green.  It is a great all purpose oil that holds up to sauteeing, drizzling over cooked pasta, for use in salad dressings and for bread dipping.  It is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses, especially when purchased on subscription basis. This comes in a clear bottle, not my preference for storage of olive oils, so I have wrapped the bottles with foil to minimize light exposure and slow degradation.  Oils can also be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality.",2
2078,"This ""water enhancer"" was really tasty and you don't have to use a lot of it to flavor even a large glass of water. The flavor was good without being overpowering, and it's fun using the little bottle. My only complaint is the price. At $3.99 per bottle (Kraft's listed price on their site, not Amazon's), you're paying more for the bottle and the wow-factor than the actual flavoring itself. While this is a really good product, I don't imagine I'll be spending four bucks on less than two ounces of flavoring and a ""futuristic"" bottle.",2
2085,"All my family really likes this rice. It goes good with fish, chicken or stakes.",2
2087,Didn't know what to expect when I ordered this product.  But was pleasantly surprised about how good it is and the value.  Definitely will buy again.,2
2092,These beans were really very good.  Added a ham slice while cooking and came out great.  Each time I've made the soup it's be consistently yummy!,2
2093,"This is the best tasting hot sauce ever, yes hot sauce with a flavor ,my first bottle of this sauce came from a VERY VERY good friend when I found out what grocery store it came from i bought all they had now they tell me they cant get it anymore :( so where do i go? Amazon , but shipping for 2 bottles of this fine hot sauce is more than the sauce its self ,",2
2104,"This brand of pasta is easy to cook, and taste great. My children can't tell the difference between it and wheat pasta.",2
2110,"Tinkyada Brown Rice Penne Pasta with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) Tinkyada makes pasta that actually tastes like pasta. I have tried many different brands and nobody comes close to Tinkyada. If you are allegeric to wheat you can have great tasting pasta again.",2
2112,"Ingredients on Deep River Snacks's website are: Potatoes, sunflower oil and/or corn oil, whey, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, garlic powder, torula yeast, dried parsley, maltodextrix, canola oil, soybean oil, rosemary extract and ""natural flavors"".  False adversing much?",2
2115,I had heard that champagne vinegar was good from TV CHEFS and cooking magazines.  I realize now just what I was missing. I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.  A little goes a long way!,2
2117,The mushrooms I received had absolutely no flavor.  It was like soaking up cream sauce with pieces of rubber.  Really disappointing.,2
2118,Definitely a very good jerky - not dry or chewy at all. Very tasty - did not need any extra flavoring. We went thru the 8 packs pretty fast even though they were supposed to last a while...,2
2127,"I started eating this after a recommendation by my hair stylist, who is into organic/healthy eating. I put 3 Tbsp on either my oatmeal or Ezekiel 4:9 cereal. It has a great nutty flavor. It is also loaded with nutrients.",2
2132,"The first time I ate it, I didn't realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom, so when I was almost done all I had left were a bunch of beans.  From then on I made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables.",2
2151,I mix this seasoning with Hunts BBQ sauce and the mix taste great on chicken. The only problem this product has is that if the enviroment you live is a bit humid the seasoning absorbs the humidity of the ambient and hardens..,2
2152,"The regular shirmp noddle soup's taste is very good, and this spicy srimp flavour has a better taste, I like it!",2
2155,"Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use. The clusters are not very big, so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking. The blueberry-vanilla flavor was a bit muted but I'm happy to compromise on that for such a hearty, healthy product.",2
2162,"The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.  I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.  I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.  In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.",2
2166,The taste of this Balsamic Vingear is very good for the price!!! Vinegar comes in a spray bottle wonderful for salads & cuts down on waste when you added to anything else!!! Vinegar comes in a six pack each bottle 8.5 Ounces.Price $33.25 for six pack but some of the Very Best sells for Over $100 a 4 Ounce bottle. I never tasted that Quality but like I stated earlier DeLallo tastes deliteful & its made in Italy!!!,2
2193,This salt is way overpriced. Go to your local store and buy Morton Sea Salt. Saltygator,2
2195,"I like the original Raisin Bran and it was a staple in our home growing up, but I think I really like this much better.  When eating the original Raisin Bran I actually added a little extra sugar, not sure why exactly, but I always felt that it needed it.  No extra sugar needed with this new Cinnamon & Almond Raisin Bran.  It has the right amount of sweetness, crunch, almonds, and cinnamon.  I was afraid the cinnamon would be overpowering, but it is a perfect balance.  Not sure if the flakes turn soggy, like the orginal flakes, because I keep eating it too fast to find out.  My six year old was eating it straight from the box last night and he said it was delicious.  I would definitely purchase this cereal again!",2
2204,"Thank you Amazon for carrying Amy's at such a reasonable price! I paid about $27 for this case, when they were trying to charge me $40 for it at my health food store. These are the BEST refried beans I've ever had---they taste even better since I add about a half a jar of salsa (mild, great value brand from Walmart) per can. I love them because they don't taste like oil and they don't make me feel sick afterwards, as other refried bean brands sometimes do. I definitely recommend!",2
2206,"Tastes too sweet, which Jerk Seasoning is not.  Walker's woods is the most authentic to taste.  This was a waste.",2
2217,"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.  The ""Original"" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well.",2
2223,"Has a nice taste and consistency to it.  It is very slippery after its cooked, so it definately does not stick like regular pasta. Feels a little lighter in the stomach as well, not like a giant glue ball like regular pasta. Seems to be a nice healthy alternative.",2
2231,"These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though.",2
2252,O.N.E. has a good taste for packed coconut water. If you are used to drink coconut water it is important to know that it will never taste like a fresh green coconut. I also make ice cubes with coconut water to use in cocktails and whisky. It tastes great!,2
2253,"This black walnut has excellent flavor.  My ice cream was wonderful. I was unable to locate this in any stores.  I also purchased the bourbon vanilla.  Waiting to try that.  The ingredients were simple... water, alcohol, black walnut.",2
2258,I bought a case of these noodles and was impressed with the quality. It is greenish in color and has a hint of spinach taste to it that I really liked. It is hearty and fills you up. In summary I really liked it and would buy it again.,2
2259,"This was an awesome price for the amount of ounces, and it serves the purpose of the purchase. I would definitely recommend this to others seeking black walnut extract. Thanks!",2
2260,"Wonderful packaging, small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need. Clean tiny boned (very edible) fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings. Due to other reviews, I recommend using the first fillets you pull out from the middle for sauce (slightly broken up), the the others come out whole just fine with a cocktail fork.  I will order these again and again.",2
2263,"I enjoy Indian food but unfortunately the closest Indian restaurant is 150 miles away from my house. I've tried other commercial Indian food products and have not been very pleased. The Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry, however, is tasty, just spicy enough for me (well, maybe a little on the mild side), and easy to make. I buy the Costco rotisserie chicken, debone it, put it in 1 pound zip-lock bags, and freeze them. Each envelope of the Butter Curry needs 1 pound of chicken, so I just pop the chicken out of the freezer, defrost it, add the curry paste and butter, and in about 20 minutes I have a delicious dinner. I will definitely be ordering this product again.",2
2266,"Can you really ever go wrong with the most trusted name in oatmeal? In fact, can you ever really go wrong with oatmeal? It's pretty hard to screw up oatmeal. The only factor at play here is if you like the flavor. I really enjoy oatmeal but I hate the effort that it can take compared to getting a bowl of cereal. These instant packs take virtually no time and you don't have to mess with extra ingredients like brown sugar and maple extract, etc. They come in many different flavors and if you like oatmeal and you like brown sugar, this is a quick and easy way to satisfy your morning hunger.",2
2275,"Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah.",2
2299,I am loving this coconut oil.  It's a difficult thing to find in stores and I've been searching for a good alternative to cooking with olive oil since it has such a low smoke point.  All the other sites I found it was too expensive so I tried this and have replaced it 100% as my only cooking oil.  It's light and flavorful and has a lot of health benefits to go with it!,2
2307,This is our favorite jerk sauce and it was sent correctly and speedily by the merchyant so all is well.,2
2310,This spagetti sauce is really good.  The spinach is amazing taste to it.  You will love this and enjoy it time and time again.  Also for those (like me) whom are alergic to onions there are none in it.  Enjoy,2
2311,"This cereal is absolutely delicious!  It even tastes good if you are eating it as chips!  The multibran and high fiber content are good for your health, too.",2
2315,The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.,2
2319,You have created a product which is low in fat and calories and high in taste.  Thank you for the bulk pack.,2
2333,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so,2
2335,"I only had one packet to test of this product and I put it into a 8oz. glass of hot water. It is mostly ginger flavored with just a hint of lemon. The ginger is so strong that it actually tastes a bit like sweetened pepper and it leaves a kind of nasty taste in your mouth after it goes down. Perhaps, it might be better if you only added a bit of the packet to tea, or only used a bit of the packet in the water because, the ginger is very overwhelming. I was hoping for more lemon flavoring to balence out the ginger. This probably is good to settle the stomach, IF you can stomach the flavor....so this won't be a product that I'd use again.",2
2336,"I've been partial to Emerald's products so my favorable reaction to this one comes as no surprise to me.  However, I would warn that this may not be to everyone's taste - at least at first.  The sea salt definitely has more kick than the usual salted nuts and the pepper gives it a decided bite.  For those whose taste in nuts tend more towards sweeter concoctions, this may be a bit much.  But for those who like dark beer, strong coffee, and snacks with attitude, this is a welcome treat.",2
2341,"I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.",2
2343,"We tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities. We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil you'll be much happier, we are.  Also wait for the white truffles to come in from Italy, I would not knock JR as a company but would not recommend this offering.",2
2350,Very tasty and fiber-rich cereal.  I ate it cold with soy milk and finished the box off myself.  I am buying more!!!,2
2358,"Yummy healthy taste. Great as a quick protein snack. The amount of salt is perfect for warm and hot weather, when your body will lose salt through sweat and also the salt helps to retain water in your body. Give it as a Gift.",2
2359,"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.",2
2366,"I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter??",2
2376,"A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem.",2
2377,"My Japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black, pungent and quite frightening. HongCho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good! Don't let the ""vinegar"" scare you off - it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down. I guess it really depends on how much you dilute it. I believe the package says 1:3 for a strong taste or 1:4 or 1:5 for a lighter taste. I've tried both the Pomegranate and Blueberry flavors and they were both good. You can also mix the concentrate with milk, yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it.  The bottle recommends drinking after a work out, after a bath or before bed. The purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being, improvement in digestion, speeding up metabolism and skin benefits. I've only been drinking this for a short time so I can't really say if I've noticed any difference in health.  As far as the Amazon price, I got a smokin deal at my local H Mart and picked up a bottle for only $6. The regular price is $10/bottle so the Amazon price isn't too bad, especially if you don't have a Korean grocery store nearby.",2
2389,"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half.",2
2390,"This sauce tastes pretty good! It's creamy, spicy (but not overly so), and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other Mexican-style foods. That said, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is. The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye. So in summary, what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price. I would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack, to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you.",2
2391,"tastes - burnt, roasted, slightly rotten sunflower seed taste; gritty, bland - no salt,sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free.""",2
2392,I purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices. i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis. i was pretty disappointed. the juice is very strong. i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini. the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice. it was way too salty. the olive juice was over powering. i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1/4 part olive juice. i would not recommend this item.,2
2393,"It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own.",2
2398,"I love this cereal - it's sweet without being cloyingly sweet. You can eat a bowl and not feel like you've overdone your sugar ration for the rest of the day! We love Golden Grahams with the plain soy milk - unlike other cereals, this tastes just the same with regular milk or with soy milk.",2
2400,"I despise low-fat/non-fat dressings and would prefer to eat a salad plain rather than use them.  But these Walden Farms Dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous.  My husband likes them too, and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything.",2
2411,"It is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water.  Make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out.  It was a little hard to use my fingers to eat.  I bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking.  It is light weight, healthy, and fulfilling as a part of my lunch.  The calorie count is good (80 per packet) and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel.  I can also see it being added into rehydrated TVP, rehydrated instant refried beans, and canned soup, etc..  I also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry.  it's a super healthy snack (if u prefer savory snack).  Overall I am very happy to have it in my pantry so that I can grab it whenever i need one or two.",2
2416,"For a great appetizer, stuff these little guys with goat cheese (or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese) and a little fresh basil.  Just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie, sqish to mix (add mild if too thick), cut a corner from the bag, and squeeze into the drained Peppadews.  They'll be the hit of the dinner party.  For style points, serve in a long skinny olive dish.",2
2434,"It smells a little funny, but tastes fine and I like it for its health benefits.",2
2437,"This soup mix is so easy and tastes great! That being said, I add, 1 can of chicken breast, 1 can of white kidney beans, 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of frozen corn. I also add another 2 cups of water so it yields much more than 6 servings and is VERY hearty!  Overall, still a great price!",2

2445,"This is delicious olive oil and it's a HUGE can! I bought this on lightning deal to have a ""dipping"" olive oil. It definitely fits the bill. It's wonderful for dipping nice bread in. I was expecting it to taste like kalamata olives, but it is actually from Kalamata, Greece and just tastes like regular nice olive oil.",2
2448,"I bought this for a trial run with my new meat grinder and it was excellent! It took a total of two days for shipping and the price was great, too!",2
2478,"Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.  The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.  The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly. That said, it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way.",2
2488,"These little taffy's are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn't let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldn't eat the taffy some days and would be fine.

2493,"Dr. McDougall's organic maple brown sugar light oatmeal is a fanatstic, healthy way to start your day. Made from organic oats & naturally sweetened, this hot cereal is miles ahead of the national brands found in your neighborhood grocery store. This oatmeal a delicious whole-grain, fiber rich way to make breakfast more nutritious. In fact, Dr. McDougall's instant oatmeal is a great light snack anytime of the day! Given the great deal Dr. McDougall's is on Amazon.com, national & bargain store brands of instant oatmeal simply cannot compete, even in a tight economy! Very well worth a try! Highly recommended!",2

2499,"Some of my friends who I have offered these to say they taste like SOAP.  And even I have to admit they have a very unusual taste, but that is what I love about them!  AND they leave your breath smelling wonderful for a really long time afterwards.  I first purchased these at World Market, but here I got them at less than half of what they sell them for each there.  Live on the edge, try Violet candy today!  I wish they also made them in Lavendar flavor too.",2

2507,"Nutiva Organic Hemp Seeds are so good for you.  They are 33% protein, 9% Omega 3, and GLA.  I think the MSRP on these bags is $14 each so Amazon has these priced at almost half-price!  This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.  Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed-n-saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.  Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.  Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.  Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp: 1cup hemp seeds 1 cup spring water 1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer dash himalyan salt optional flavoriing = cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom  Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.  Pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue.  Will keep in refrigerator for 4-5 days but I recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious.  You could also make a great milk out of  Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter",2

2529,"I am becoming one of Goya's biggest fans. I had seen these on the shelves, and they were really inexpensive, but I opted for a test can of Vienna sausages instead. They were so good I went back the next day to get this tin of sardines.  They have a great sardine flavor, not fishy or oily at all, and the tomato sauce is thick and rich. I am of the opinion that sardines make everything taste better, and these go great just on a regular saltine. Great for snacks or a pack lunch or road trips. I'll probably edit this review sometime in the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL",2
2537,"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies).",2

2560,"I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent.",2

2579,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.  The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.  What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.",2
2581,"Ok Folks - listen up. For special occasions, we'll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb.  You're lucky today if you can even find it in the stores - it's so expensive - often at $20-40 per pound.  So, the very last thing you want to do, after spending all that money, is ruin it with the wrong flavoring. Colorado Spices, New Zealand Lamb Rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat.  We just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was FANTASTIC. My 88 year old Mother, who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan (she's used to plain, New England cooking) loves and uses the rub on chicken, lamb, and fish.  She's having me order another case and loves the individual packets - as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh.  This is a great product!",2
2582,I really thought EFS was an excelent product that gives me the extra push to make it through long rides.  Compared to Accelerade it is better however more expensive.  As an amature rider I am not sure that it is worth the extra cost.,2

2592,"This soup is totally delicious. I don't even know how to describe it. It's just great. It has a little zing to it. Not too spicy though; I don't like spicy things, and I like it.  Be sure to let it set for a while after you cook it. The texture is much smoother after you let it sit.",2
2597,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.,2
2603,"I like these little cheese chips. They satisfy my craving for something crunchy. And who doesn't like that last little bit of crispy cheese from your toasted cheese sandwich. That's what these are like. Just beware - I didn't notice right away that one bag held four servings, not just one. They are pretty rich so it would be hard to eat the whole bag, but I could see munching on half of the bag, which would be 150 calories.",2
2635,I have never used Gluten free pasta before. I absolutely love this pasta. I enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving. It is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta. I say this because my daughter decided to make spaghetti for herself and added pasta in pan of water before it was boiling. Well what happened was a glob of gooey mess. Lesson learned.,2
2639,"I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.  I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.",2

2650,"I haven't recieved the noodles yet, but I'm very impressed with the price! With my sights set on making a soba dish, I headed to the grocery store to find that an eight-ounce package of Soba noodles was selling for $7. And my recipe called for twelve ounces! I just could not see paying $14 for a simple noodle dish. As an experiment, I bought one package of soba noodles, and one $3 package of Udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary. The soba noodles were significantly better for this dish, so I was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish.  Then I came here to and found that I can get a larger package of noodles for a little over $3 per package (after shipping)! I was very pleased. I hope they taste good! I'll be back for more, as I think I'm becoming addicted to Soba noodles!",2
2651,"I have always made fresh coconut cake - filtering the coconut milk & grating the ""meat"" myself. These cupcakes are as close as you can come to ones made from a fresh coconut. As with most baked goods, if you let them sit a while (say at least 4-6) hours the flavor is even more intense -- of course, they have lots of butter in them, so how can they NOT be good!",2
2652,This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!,2
2653,"I honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously, it is good! If you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste, it's like eating sweet fresh grass. It is gritty but it doesn't bother me at all.",2
2656,"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.  I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!  I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.",2
2664,"Delicious tuna that is low in mercury and line caught.  This is skipjack tuna, which is dark in color, low in mercury and has a sushi like taste.  Try it and you'll be hooked (pun intended).",2
2667,Great tasting mild mustard. Is excellent on sandwiches. Don't buy if you like your mustard hot and spicy. Also its organic!,2
2676,"Gluten free pasta can be less than acceptable- this brand of pasta tastes just like regular pasta. Even my husband, who is not gluten free, loves the taste. I have tried all the styles of their brown rice pasta- Excellent!",2
2677,Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.,2

2693,"I found this Fajita sauce and the related Chimichurri sauce at a local Global Foods mart, but after using the bottles up, my wife recycled them and I had forgotten the brand name.  So I spent the next 6 months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping - apparently the local mart stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I bought lots of Chimichurri sauce brands - most of which were not nearly as delicious as I recalled this brand to be - until on a whim I looked up ""chimichurri"" here on Amazon.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the World Harbors label, I recognized the brand again! :-)  Anyway, whenever I make burritos or tacos, I add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family & guests now think I should go into the restaurant business! :-P",2

2704,"Mmm...this boxed macaroni and cheese kit is great. The cheese sauce is smooth and creamy and there is just enough ro-tel included to give the mac some kick-without making it runny. As a bonus, it only takes about 15 mins. to prepare.  Note: The ro-tel isn't mixed in with the cheese sauce, so you can add as much or as little of the tomato sauce as you'd like to the mac-or just skip it and use it in another dish. You could just add the tomato sauce to your portion if the kiddies don't like tomatoes. (Note: One box only makes 2 servings, unless you have tiny eaters).  Try it!",2
2708,"I bought my first jar of Kraft's Vegemite (the Australian brand) and I must say the flavor is strong, salty, and slightly bitter.  Every morning I have a bit of Vegemite on my buttered toast.  I have quickly become very fond of this new morning ritual.  It is an excellent source of folic acid and B Vitamins.  I recommend that you experience the flavor sensation for yourself.",2
2715,"This penne pasta is delicious. My family prefers it to the regular wheat-based pasta. And it's good for you to, and gluten-free.",2
2716,Ok this salt is a must have if you really like to cook. I think it has a good flavor and the price is really good. Even if you don't use it everyday it is good to add to your spices.,2
2724,This sauce is pretty good. It's 55 calories per tablespoon. I tried this sauce with chicken and really liked it. It's not too spicy at all. I don't usually eat spicy food and am very sensitive to even small amounts of heat in my food. This sauce hardly had any heat at all.,2
2732,We were eating a meal in Hawaii with some Aloha Shoyu on the table.  We didn't think anything of it until we tried some and found that this tastes really good - different from Kikkoman and the like.  If you like soy sauce be sure to try some of this.,2
2748,"I'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.  I was so frustrated at Safeway where one bean was $13(!), dry and hard as a rock. The best I've found was at Trader Joe's, where I could get three beans for $10. They were decent...  This price was SO reasonable, that I worried they were not going to be fresh/good/etc. I was wrong. The beans were incredibly fresh and supple. I'm using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly. They keep well in the fridge, so I'm using them in everything!  The price is great, but there might be too many to use--if that's the case, then split them with a friend. Then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever.  Absolutely wonderful. I will buy these again and again.",2
2749,"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.",2
2754,"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor.",2
2760,"The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don't believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it's not that I don't know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow.",2

2798,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):  Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)  )",2
2804,"This is a great sauce to use on sandwiches to give them a little extra kick.  Love it with grilled chicken, lettuce, and tomato.  I would thin it a bit to use on a salad, but it's just right with a sandwich.  Could get creative with it.  Meatloaf, maybe?",2
2806,"A brother in a Sicilian family who owns an Italian Food Market & Deli here in San Diego, tipped me off to this product over a year ago.  The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The product is not widely known but the laboratories at Academia Barilla in Italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion, it is the very best.  The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.  Use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience.  Quality makes a difference.",2
2813,"These sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket (usually the David's brand in my area) so there's more inner seed to eat.  There's also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them, so while there's enough salt to make things tasty, your lips aren't going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand.  The shells are easy to crack with your teeth, and they break cleanly; also the bags are filled with full-shelled seeds - there are very few broken ones.  I devoured the first batch I ordered, and I'm now ordering a second batch.  If you like snacking on sunflower seeds, I think you'll like these.",2
2822,This is the best angel hair pasta as far as I am concerned.  The taste and texture are great.,2
2826,"I use this on a lot of foods - it has a hint of hotness in large amounts, but nothing overpowering.  My favorite use right now is to top off chicken breasts prior to grilling - amazing how great they taste, and my friends have had nothing but good things to say about it.",2
2832,great tuna. Nice chunky texture. You can actually taste the tuna instead of the salt.,2
2867,"First time Id ever purchased whole nutmeg, and I am glad that I did!  It is so much better than already ground nutmeg, lasts longer and it quiet simple to use with a good microplane grater!",2
2881,"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.  One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.  Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.",2
2891,I used to be able to buy this in the grocery stores but no longer.  I don't know why since it's the best pepper out there for cooking and flavoring.  It's easy to use (grind is just right) and more flavorful than bland black pepper.  I use it in salads and whenever I am adding pepper to a recipe.,2
2897,Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.,2
2904,"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank.",2
2911,"I just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner.  Luckily, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry.  I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.  After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.  My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.",2
2916,"Not the best canned mushrooms on Earth, but the price is good and they are definitely OK for tossing in a pot of spaghetti sauce or using as an extra ingredient in a soup or stir fry when there are no fresh mushrooms in the house. Just make sure that you rinse them thoroughly first, as they have a slightly canned taste if they aren't washed.",2
2921,"Picked one up to use with a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.  The computer saw the item, but said it needed troubleshooting.  Nothing worked.  After researching online, I found that many people had run into this problem.  Apparently, the firmware is not compatible with Windows 7; it's supposedly been corrected in newer runs, but there's no way to tell if the one you're purchasing is newer or not.  I tried contacting Blue, twice, hoping to get a firmware update, or check into exchanging it, but never got a response from both attempts, so I finally just had to return it.",2
2938,"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!  First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!  Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!",2
2939,"I bought this in an effort to reduce my sodium intake and replace ketchup on everything I eat.  I've put in on eggs, cauliflower, cabbage and some meat dishes.  Tastes great!  Very happy with this and will try some other flavors.",2

2944,"Don't be swayed by what some reviewers are saying about Annie's Natural Shells and Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese. I almost didn't purchase this product because of some of the reviews I read on here, but I'm glad I did. It's not only healthy and fast, but actually pretty tasty too. If you're expecting something all natural that tastes like Kraft, you're going to be disappointed. Kraft's sauce is thicker and sweeter, but Annie's sauce tastes less processed and has a better all-around flavor. I prefer the Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese to the White Cheddar one (which was very bland). Try adding a little extra butter to enhance the flavor of the sauce.",2
2962,"Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And what's up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so I'm throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you! (Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)",2
2965,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.  Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors).",2
2966,"FOR A NON-ORGANIC OR NON-GOURMET ITEM THIS TASTES AMAZINGLY FRESH, CRUNCHY AND YUMMY. BEWARE: CALORIE COUNT, FAT AND SALT CONTENT IS CONSIDERABLE.

2967,"Excellent 'old world' flavor and style.  It has been years since I had salame this good or natural.  No MSG, etc.  Almost impossible to find anyplace else.  I wish someone locally carried it, but I am glad I can get it online.",2
2995,"The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container.",2
3011,"I love this organic coconut manna. I eat it by the spoonful and I use it for cooking. It has a light, pleasant coconut flavor. The packaging is convenient and keeps the product fresh. The benefits of coconut are wonderful. Give it a try!",2
3012,"The spice and flavor go hand-in-hand, so I usually add all of the flavor packet. I make these slightly soupy, and I often discard a little of the broth to reduce sodium levels + spare my digestive tract from the ravages of my taste buds. Also great (and more of a meal) with egg stirred in near the end. I could eat these every day, but alas, that would have dire consequences.  Taking the nutritional drawbacks as a given, these are 5* for price/flavor.",2
3013,"These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor.",2
3016,"I have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit.  This is by far the best tasting of all I have tried.  It has no ""off-putting"" bite to it.  Many do!  I love it so much I cannot stop making my homemade pannatone.  I guess I can thank you for these 5 extra pounds!!!  If you use this type of product(I am Italian) so I do, I highly encourage you to give it a try.  maria domenica",2

3022,"Just a quick note... a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product.  We bought a box at Whole Foods and I was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content.  Amazingly it's about 40% cheaper at Amazon than at Whole Foods, and being an Amazon Prime customer saved me on shipping. I'll be back for more soon.  I love quality and a bargain.",2
3026,"Wanted organic walnuts and now I have them.  Convenient that they are in 3 separate bags so I don't have to open at one time.  Good tasting, bits and halves.",2

3045,This is a great value especially on subscribe and save and keeps well with the re-sealable top. Red quinoa has a great flavor and the color is appealing if you are introducing quinoa to a newbie. The protein benefit is nice as well.,2
3062,"Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of ""Chicken"" but the horrid taste even overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog.",2
3066,"If you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious...this is the way. While cooking noodles...microwave left over meat/hot dog/boloni(sp?). Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over/frozen/canned. After noodles cook/add season packet...pour over meat/veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP/quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libby's carot/peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time!",2
3087,"I have always like sardines and recently decided to start eating them on nearly a daily basis.  I bought two cases of these Season sardines in water and started taking them to work to eat as a snack.  I really like the taste!  These came 3 to a can, seemed to be of the larger type.  They still had the skin and bones, which was fine by me.  I love the taste of fish, so I didn't have much interest in the skinless and boneless, bland tasting ones.",2
3094,"Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well.",2
3103,Arrived undamaged and on time. Add's a nice touch to beans and rice. Not alot of flavor but not a bad addition to the spice rack.,2
3109,I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!,2
3111,I love the walnut oil. It came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. The walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil I bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. I recommend it to anyone.,2
3120,"We've been using walnut oil for many years; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter, eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It's also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes, and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it.",2
3128,I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either,2
3140,"I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.  I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.  A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more.",2
3150,"These are wonderful baked beans, with subtle, not overwhelming, curry seasoning.  Also very healthy--protein, fiber, no saturated or trans fat. Only minor caveat is sodium, a bit high, but nothing like many beans/""bowls"" found in US stores.",2
3162,"If you love couscous but hate paying the price of the leading brand, give this one a try.

3164,"This was an unusual treat that I normally would not think about getting. However, I got it and was very surprised at how food it actually was. Surprises await you when you try new things.",2
3172,I honestly think it makes my regular recipes taste better then when I make them with table salt. About half as salty as table salt so the 5 lb bag was a must for me. Reasonable price. Great way to lead a little bit healthier lifestyle. You're going to eat salt anyway so why not get the extra minerals and a great taste.,2
3173,This popcorn tastes great. The only complaint I have is that it is way too salty (and we like salty). All we do is pour out a tiny bit of salt before adding it to the kettle and it's perfect.,2
3179,The salt is great quality and taste - if you haven't already stooped using table salt (Sodium Chloride) I urge you to read about the benefits of using Himalayan salt - not only does it taste better - it is much better for your health.,2

3239,"Open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles. The taste is even better. A little goes a long way. I add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent. Like another review, I also love this salt in popcorn. I add a pinch to my oil (usually clarified butter) before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle. A nice change of pace.  This salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper. The truffle flavor is infused throughout. The salt I received on 5/31/2010 has a 'best before' date of 10/28/2012.",2

3274,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.  Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.  I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.  The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]  When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)  Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.  The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.  I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee.",2

3386,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein.  First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious.  They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein.  The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.  Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.  As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.

This is really sad too, because the product is great.",2
3401,I never liked the taste of the refried beans in a can. I tried these and they were just as good as the kind you get in a mexican food restaurant. Melt some cheese on top.  I just ordered two of the cases of 8 each.,2
3405,"I saw these as I was checking out of a beer store (honestly!) and thought I would give them a try. They are all organic, and taste great. They are also all shaped somewhat differently roundish, which gives them a unique - homemade - look. The color is a bit off-white as well, with some dark chunks (small, but not specks) in them, which adds to the unique appearance. These are not made with artificial sweeteners, yet the calorie/carb content is very low. The mint flavor is interesting, because I found it got MORE intense as kept on sucking, not less so as others do. Great product, and much cheaper here than where I bought mine. Cool!",2
3419,"I have opened hundereds ifnot thousands of cans of peeled italian tomotoes and for the money these are as good as i have ever had; as good or better than Campania pomidori pelati; very red, rich, and sweet.",2
3424,"These pickles are amazing.  Once you have tried this unremarkable flavor, you won't go back to those retail manufactured brand of pickles.  Nothing comes close to these pickles.  Definitely will be a repeat customer!",2
3427,"These are better than the usual canned fish filets, tastier, and not dry.  There are no bones or skins.  I worried about Mackerel but they are much nicer than, say, kippered herring filets or sardines in oil.  It's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry, but you'd be losing something that is also tasty.",2
3429,"Cheese is great, just what we were looking for considering it is hard to find this product.",2
3430,"They were very tasty. Bought them for my son,he is interested in anything Japanese. They last a while in your mouth but not too chewy almost like gum you can swallow. They have a great flavor not to sweet or tart. I highly recommend them. the price was good as well $11 for 10 pack I believe.",2
3434,"Not the most economical way to buy this, but the packets are convenient and the cheesy garlic is delicious without being overpowering.",2
3439,The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time.,2
3447,"I am pleased with this salad dressing. The olive oil flavor comes through nicely. I have used this salad dressing on regular garden type salads and it tastes like home made dressing. I have also used in pasta salad and it adds a zesty taste. Using this olive oil based dressing is a good marinade for meats, chicken or even veggies, especially if grilling. There is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food. If you like vinegrette, you will find many uses for this product. I highly recommend it.",2
3452,"i think these peppercorns are bland, tasteless, it lacks the pepper spiciness, will never buy this brand again.It was a fail choice to say the least",2
3457,"How much is there really to say about salt?  The size of the ground crystals will depend on your grinder - I find fine to be good for some foods (like eggs) and prefer a coarser grind for other foods (potatos).  The Sea Salt has a more complex flavor than regular, ""plain"" table salt.  For me, the flavor of the Sea Salt is much prefered over normal salt.",2
3467,I use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price.  Frontier met that discription.,2
3474,Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.,2
3475,"Hi,  Bought these for my parents and I am glad that I made right choice. Parents as well as myself I eat them regularly. I eat my whey protein powder in milk before I mix these cereals. My father has diabetes but he has no complaints.",2
3502,"These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top. I've bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty.  Maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ??? I can't eat these unless I take the time to try and wipe off the salt, which talks forever!!",2
3528,"I go through a lot of coconut milk and this is the only brand I'll buy because Native Forest is the only company I know of that uses BPA free cans.  However the product is very inconsistent.  Sometime I get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery, curdled, and gritty.  The watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all.  I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.  Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.  It's really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product.",2
3529,"These healthy flakes taste very good even though they are low in sugar and high in fiber and nutritional value. They do lose their crispiness in a bowl of milk, but I either eat fast or snack on the flakes right out of the box. These make a great healthy substitute for other wheat flake cereals on the market.",2
3534,"I had tried a tahini before I bought the Kevala tahini and I didn't like it at all.Then I found the Kevala tahini on Amazon and I decided to give it a try. I love it, it's rich,creamy, organic and it tastes good. I will probably buy it again.",2
3545,I like these. They are not gas-producing and they hold shape OK for canned beans. Flavor is good. Love that they don't have added salt.,2
3590,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.,2
3594,"I have tried every variety of Popchips and this one is by far my favorite.  The pepper gives it just the right amount of spice.  If you love your food to have a little kick to it, then you will love these chips!",2
3636,"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can.",2
3640,i purchased 2 single packs from a supermarket i made them by using the provided method but i added 2 eggs (the soup base got way too thick) for the other pack i did the same but added extra water (it was much better),2
3642,All the cooking shows tell you it's important not to skimp on the vanilla extract.  This is the good stuff at a good price.,2
3656,This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don't make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere.,2
3658,"Love the taste of this sauce. We have been using this for over a year. Great price, good quality, using this makes the pasta very yummy. A great buy.",2
3661,"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning.",2
3667,"This is a tasty seasoning mix.  The instructions call for deep frying the chicken, but it tastes just as good if you pan fry with minimal oil.  It is not that spicy, so add some pepper sauce if you like it really hot.  You can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money, but the pre-mixed packet is nice for lazy people who don't have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen.",2
3670,"If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you...",2
3680,"The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper.",2
3684,I have never used vanilla bean paste so I wasn't sure what to expect.  This was an excellent purchase! I have made some very delicious cupcakes and am very glad I have this in my baking pantry for future use!,2
3686,"I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.  I purchased a very expensive Vodka, unusual bottles to fill, and waited for my bean order to arrive.  I wasn't happy about the wait.  The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source.",2
3688,"This soup is great. Of course its more expensive because it is non gmo and organic. The chicken-like bits are just like the real chicken noodle soup style. Its a great soup, kids will love it too if they already like this style of soup!",2
3691,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!",2
3698,This is a great dish!  I thoroughly enjoy it every time I eat it.  So easy to prepare.,2
3707,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest.",2
3713,"this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine, but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me.",2
3722,Fast delivery.  I like the fact I am getting 84 trace minerals and iodine.  Better than normal table salt.  Also bought the bulk package too.,2
3725,"I cannot comment on price because this is not sold locally; however, I can comment on taste.  These are so simple to cook and healthy.  I found a really good lentil soup recipe to use these in.",2
3730,"A good product overall. It's just a base, so anything you add will step up the flavor. Tastes good with any meat. A little butter and plain yogurt mixed in makes it smooth a creamy. The TIGER TIGER and PATAK's ready-made sauces are good too.",2
3731,"I have been drinking the original Cheribundi for a bit now, but it was a tad expensive.  So I checked out Amazon and they had it for a bit less.  I discovered they have additional flavors like the Ginger Cherry.  Cherries help calm inflammation, which is why I picked it up the first time.  I have a bottle about every other day and use it to flavor my homemade kombucha.  Great item.",2
3734,The lemon flavor was evident in this product.The price was right and just big enough to satisfy our needs.Would buy again.,2
3740,"I like these.  They are short enough to be cute, but stretch enough to cover everything vital. They are very comfortable and stretchy, not too tight.  They wash up nice without pilling and I have had no problem with the gold rear design peeling or coming off.",2
3742,"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.  This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.  Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.  Give it a try!  Thank you for reading my review.",2
3749,"Bold and tangy, the Taco Bell Spicy Ranchero Sauce is excellent.  We've used it with tacos and with flautas, and now there is none left in our sample bottle!  Everyone liked it, even those who normally don't care for spicy foods.  Off to the grocery for more!",2
3752,I originally found this product in a specialty shop in Monterey and am so glad to have found it here! Great fresh garlic flavor. I love it on steaks but the wife likes it on fish. Actually no fat but you'd never know it. Very versatile.,2
3765,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.",2
3766,"Without going into any of the actual health benefits, I'm just commenting on how tasty these bars are. Very chocolaty and delicious. I will definitely purchase these again.",2
3770,These cranberries are plump and taste great. They have a nice aroma and just the right amount of sugar. Great.,2
3773,"this meat is very fresh and taste very good. its already cooked,you just warm it up in the frying pan . its sliced thin.  its lot better than the one at the restaurants",2
3782,"The taste is good and not too hot.  My only problem is the sodium in 1 tsp is 260mg or 11% of the daily allowance.  A sodium-free product would be much better IMHO.  This product is really salty on the palate.  If you mix it with  Pomi Chopped Tomatoes, 26.46 Ounce Tetra Pack (Pack of 12)  and garlic, you get a good Arrabiata sauce.  This is about half as hot as  Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce Huy Fong 17 Oz.",2
3789,Absolutely NO cheese flavor at all. All you can taste is salt salt salt. Save your money and try something else.,2
3791,"This is really yummy instant coffee. I like the fine, powdery texture. However, I am not convinced it is organic coffee.....as the amazon description states. The can does not say anything regarding organic ingredients. Maybe since it is produced outside the US, it's not labeled as such?? But, I will not be re-ordering due to that.",2
3792,"These are very tasty, and you can find these udon noodles at most stores. I really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor.",2
3797,"This product is SO fantastic!! The smoked salt is a perfect flavor for so many foods. My entire family LOVES cooking with this salt and we have a bottle of it on the table for personal use too. It's not too salty at all, it just adds a touch of saltiness and a wonderful smokiness to any dish. It's great on meats, potatoes, with cheddar cheese, eggs... It's a healthy alternative to bacon. It is so versatile it's amazing. This purchase is also a great deal- you get 3 jars for a great price! We love it and plan to continue to purchase this product so we'll never have to be without it again.",2
3798,I first bought this in Mallorca and brought it back to the states. Fantastic salt on fresh tomatoes from the garden couples with balsamic and great spanich olive oil...can't miss,2
3820,"The black walnuts come in large pieces not whole or halved.  They are fresh, taste good, and I will buy them again in the future. By the way, I read in ""Breakthrough: Eight Steps to Wellness"" that black walnuts have some unique health benefits.",2
3827,"I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money.",2
3833,This is a very tasty ready to eat Indian meal. The curry is especially delicious. I will likely buy again.,2
3841,These are from China and nowhere as good as those from Italy. Spend the extra money and get those from Italy.,2
3842,"You can't find a better tasting mustard, Not only is great with Nathan's Hot Dogs but taste great with anything that you want to put mustard on.",2
3850,"I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I like salt and pepper flavors in general, but this one has a bit garlic and onion flavor to it that I liked a lot.  The pepper isn't too hot, but it gives it a nice kick. The pepper flavor doesn't compare with freshly ground pepper, naturally, but it's pretty good for a commercially made product.  It's a tiny bit too salty for my taste, but I know that tends to be personal preference that's different for everybody.  The nuts are well roasted and crunchy. They're also a really nice size--too often I see tiny nuts that don't have much flavor. These nuts are tasty.  I would get these again. These would be an interesting snack to serve to guests.",2
3856,"I have tried all the commercial brands of Hemp Milk. The second best to Tempt is Hemp Bliss by Manitoba Harvest, which is more ""green"" tasting. Tempt Unsweetened Original is delicious enough to drink straight with no grassy notes. After a few mornings of breakfast with Tempt, I feel like I am almost eating cereal with milk. By itself it is refreshing.  What's greatest of all is that there are no pesticides or herbicides, and no GMOs and hemp is grown on sustainable farms. The ingredients are free of gums, preservatives, chemicals and flavor enhancers and this one has no sweeteners. The only real downside is, like almost every commercial producer, they insist on adding traces of cheap vitamins to produce an unbleak ""Nutritional Analysis."" I take exception to the addition of ""Vitamin A Palmitate"" in particular as having no health benefits whatsoever.",2
3858,"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag",2
3863,"This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)  The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The sauce, while simple marinara, was really good. Just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste. The marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny.  Overall a very good product that I would eat again.",2
3877,I have ordered this 3 times now. My son in Afghanistan requested some of this to be sent to him. He loves it! It is a little salty but if you eat with low salt or no salt tortilla chips it tastes great! You will love it.,2
3880,"I'm not sure how or why this soup mix is getting such good reviews. It has no flavor whatsoever. When they dehydrated the ingredients they pulled all the flavor out. I've tried everything to make a decent dish with this stuff, but always turns out bland and tasteless.  The recommend mix is also WAY off (4 cups water / mix)...you'll end up with a lintel sludge that is nothing like soup. I think I could probably calk my bathroom with it or make a nice adobe hut however.  If you are into very bland food this will probably be good. If you like flavor stay away.",2
3886,"I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes. That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up! Terrible presentation for an expensive item. As an aside, none of the cans I received has a ""DOP CERTIFIED"" label but only ""CERTIFIED"" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???",2
3900,When Habanero is in powder form it doesn't taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It's almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat.,2
3903,"This pasta is truly one of the best organic whole wheat pastas out there. It does not taste as heavy or fibery as the other brands... it comes as close to ""white"" pasta as you can get. I second the other reviewer who warns not to overcook it, as it easily falls apart.",2
3914,"Unfortunately I am completely disappointed with this product. I have an above-average sense of smell, but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. Perhaps I received part of a faulty batch? The seller is letting me return the bottle, but is requiring that I pay for shipping again, so I would be very unlikely to order from them again.",2
3916,These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn't take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone.,2
3924,Buying a latte from a coffee shop or fast-food place can be expensive and contain many calories. I was surprised to see that Hill Bros. has brought out an instant mix called Skinny Latte with has 0 grams of fat and only 100 calories. It takes 3 Tbsp. for every 8 fl oz of boiling water and it taste great!,2
3947,This a a very tasty product and it makes all beat product taste good. I have been a fan of Kraft barbecue sauce for years but I just decide to try this brand Bulls's Eye. I am glad I did and I will be switching to this brand from now on.,2
3950,"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME.",2
3955,"I am an experienced cook but new to Indian, so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters.  This was out of stock at the time I wanted it, so I contacted the Ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook (who signed my book) at their west coast CA restaurant--and it was shipped promptly the next day and I rec'd it two days later...mind you, I am on the east coast, in NY. I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.  All in all, as a beginner of Indian cooking, this was an economical and practical way to try almost 100% of the necessary spices needed for ANY cookbook of Indian cuisine. I highly recommend it.",2
3957,"This is good if you like hay for breakfast. Also, it gets soggy quickly. If you add mueslix it greatly improves it.",2
3961,"Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)   Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them.",2
3976,I think this is the best chicken rub ever!  Very tasty and very easy to prepare.  We are huge fans of roasted chicken so I try different recipes with regularity but find I keep coming back to this one.  It is a favorite and has never let us down.,2
3978,"Good Quality, very tasty - Complex and smoky flavor, very mild, though.  Break it up into bags and freeze it if you don't drink it everyday.",2
3979,"This is a staple item at our house.  I use it in soups, barbecue, meatloaf, and anything else that we want to spice up.  Pure tasting w/o any other spices overpowering the flavor.  You ""apply"" as much heat as you desire and still maintain the integrity of your recipe.  The 2 small jars were timely and intact when delivered.",2
3999,"A fantastic buy! Totally worth it.  I am done itch buying tose little packages - you're just paying of packaging there. This yeast is fantastic.

Also, whenever a recipe calls for instant yeast, I just add 25% more yeast to the recipe and it turns out perfect!",2
4014,"I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.  I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).  My secret pate recipe:  5 ounces rendered duck fat 1 lb chicken livers 1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons) 1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press 1 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 1 tbs cognac or dry sherry One loaf of 2""x2"" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter) Olive oil Garlic salt Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator. Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.",2
4021,"While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy.",2
4025,"This couscous is absolutely wonderful. The couscous is large pearl and is delicious served hot or cold.  Cooks beautifully -- delicious plain with mushrooms, mint or any one of a dozen other additions. Highly recommend it.",2
4027,I love these noodle bowls. They taste very good and you can easily add to them if you want...such as chix or more veggies. I have referred many friends to using them.,2

4051,"As far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best I've had. Actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies, mostly mushrooms and onions that I could make out. Descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix. They don't show it on the picture here but I'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup. It looks exactly like the one I just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic. If you like spicy noodles definitely don't pass this up.  Very good",2
4065,"I gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which I gave it to her (a Foie Gras dish). But I must say this price for a French truffle is amazing. I suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the $300 truffles. Good for those of you who do. But for the rest of us, this is a good choice. Linda Morse",2
4073,"Originally I hated this cereal becaused it tasted so bland and powdery when hot or cold.  However, after eating it three times, I have strangely learned to love it and now I've been eating it for one month.  So this was an acquired taste for me that I will definitely order again when I get tired of my steel cut oatmeal.  If you are not use to eating healthy foods, however, you might dislike this cereal and never acquire a taste for it.",2
4083,"I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Chipotle Sauce.  It is kind-of like a spicy mayonnaise.  I used this sauce in tuna salad, on sandwiches and as a salad dressing.  Similar to mayo, almost all of the calories come from fat.  I think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice.  You can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn't leave your mouth burning.  It's a good balance of flavors.",2
4089,EXCELLENT PRODUCT! BOB'S RED MILL BRAND IS THE BEST!  I'VE BOUGHT FLAXSEED FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS AND HAVE BOUGHT THEM FROM WELL KNOWN HEALTH FOOD STORES ONLY TO BITE INTO WHAT SEEMS LIKE PIECES OF DIRT GATHERED ALONG WITH THE SEED. ?

I add a little salt when I make a sweet food and it brings out the sweetness.  For example, add a little salt to the boiling water before you add the oatmeal.  Yumm!  Fantastic Salt!!!!",2
4173,"Since I'm vegetarian I don't use meat with this, but rather a bunch of portobello mushrooms and a whole onion.  Turns out fantastic and the leftovers are even better the next day.  Could use a few more noodles in the box, but I just buy egg noodles separately and add a few.",2
4181,"The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup.",2
4202,"Had the pleasure of trying Outerbridge's Sherry Pepper Sauce in a fish chowder.  Delicious. Have since used it for stews and other soups, and as a marinade.  Adds just the right amount of kick, with loads of flavor.  Their steak sauce and soy sauce are also devine. A little flavor of the island right here in my house.",2
4203,"First of all, I just want to say that I hate lollipops. And I do mean HATE. Even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar. I got these originally because I was intrigued by the organic label. I love that you can actually understand what's in these items and they have a video showing it being made. Great unique taste as well. Definitely well worth the price! My family and friends love it. The assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that's out there.",2
4210,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!,2
4212,"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.  I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).  Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.  I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.  If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.",2
4216,"I have tried pretty much all flavors, and it is great! I take it for lunch daily, it's quikly to preper, it is under 200 cal per meal, you save a lot of money and time do not leaving the office to a restaurant to eat, and is guilty free, bcuz is vegan! To me is a great solution for my lunch  time on weekdays, where I had daily look for a place to eat where I could get something vegetarian safe, under $10 and healthy. You will see how much money you save do NOT eating at a restaurant, bringing you own snaks and lunch from home.",2
4226,"These taste great and exactly like their ingredients. Also, they do not have too much sugar. The only thing that I would watch out for is the fat content, since each little bar have 11gms of fat.",2
4233,"The flavors in this product are absolutely fabulous. Naturally smoked lending a delicate, natural flavor of smoke. The only reason why I didn't rate a 5 star is that I find the little pellets do not dissolve well into cold dishes unlike the flaked style salts.",2
4242,"Read the ingredients on most cereal boxes then read the Kashi boxes. What a difference. You may never eat a ""regular"" cereal again. Kashi cereals taste better, eat better, and make a true cereal lover happy.",2
4247,I received these wonderful beans today through Amazon.  I have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine.  They are about 6-3/4 inches long and plump and soft. It looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans.,2
4264,this curry pates really helped me cut back on time i would spend to make a good meal .will definitely buy again,2
4269,"This is a great product that is very easy to make. It never clumps, which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes. I personally favor the Knorr white sauces (e.g. the Alfredo or Garlic Herb), which is the only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars. Overall, it's very enjoyable, nice to have around when you don't want to make sauce from scratch, and I would definitely purchase again.",2
4282,"This was my first time eating Pad Thai favored anything. These were the very thin noodles if I remember correctly. It's a unique taste compared to most ramen, I mean fried noodles, I have purchased in the last month. Definitely worth a try if you are planning on tasting some different Asian dishes.",2
4288,This product is easy to make and has a great taste.  I just wish it was gluten free.  A simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the General Tsao's Chicken by the same company.,2
4289,Great cheese. Wonderful flavor. Made my spaghetti & meatballs better than it's ever been & made the lasagna even better. Fast delivery.,2
4294,"This tea will be a staple in my cabinet.  I heard about it by word of mouth, and the reviews weren't exaggerating-- it's great!  I love the smell.",2
4301,"Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet,  and they are big bags, but I intend to share one with friends.",2
4302,"""Dead Heat"" is the finest quality ""Gucci"" hot sauce I've ever tried.  And I'm an experienced hot sauce aficionado.  It's hot enough to be powerul (use one drop at a time), yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking.  People who make hot wings at home, and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings...this is your sauce!  Very, very good.",2
4304,i like the taste no way to tell if it works for diabetes yet. i haven't taken it long enough,2
4310,These are the best tasting of the Crown Prince offerings for Sardines in Olive Oil.,2
4311,"I like cream cheese but it is too heavy. This Valbreso feta cheese tastes great though. It is not heavy. I tried it in Salad, with toast for breakfast, with Pita bread. They all taste good.",2
4315,"I really like the flavor but I don't have much choice anyways, not many pizza spices brands out there to buy. I used to buy McCourmick but they discontinued their pizza spices (I really loved their hot version). But I do like this pizza spice anyways. I just sprinkle on top of my pizza slice as I am eating it.",2
4320,"This cheddar cheese tastes great.  It's not truly a sharp tangy taste but it is cheddar. The drawback is the shipping cost of nearly $20 for 2lbs eventhough it arrives virtually over night.  The nutrional label is as follows : ( for  a 1 & 1/4 size cube ) Calories 120, total fat 10g, saturated fat 6 grams, 0 trans fats, cholesterol 30mg, sodium 210, total carbs less than 1 g, protein 7 grams. This cheese cannot be frozen as the label states.  It can be stored in the fridge up to one month but we consumed this in a week for a special party.  ( I included the nutritional content due to the marketplace did NOT state the facts when I bought this;  hopefully this helps other consumers )",2
4324,"I am kinda a noodle-bowl connoisseur. I've eaten lots of different ones at lunch over the years. The flavor of these bowls are noticeably better than other brands. Needless to say I am a big fan. The bowls have enough food to fill me up fine, but probably won't satisfy my husband. Also its not very spicy. I always end up adding a good amount of Sriracha. But that's just me. I recommend.",2
4326,"Good product that we are all accustomed to at a very reasonable price. I do have to be cautious to not over salt when using this, so I tend to use more fresh garlic, and add this in lieu of salt in equal quantities.",2
4337,We've tried several different brands of couscous.  This is our favorite.  It's a healthy choice that tastes great!,2
4343,This sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc.  It has just enough heat to make everything taste better.,2
4346,"This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked -- roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!  Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so.",2
4353,Great tasting snack!  Like viewer said taste like Sugar Smacks.  My husband and I enjoy eating the puffed cakes.  34 calories 0 fat awesome! Puffed Cakes and a glass of fat free milk is good eating.  Thank you Amazon. Jesus bless us all!,2
