1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.",1
3,"It taste okay, but they are  not soft and the taste doesn't stay very long. I wouldn't buy them again.",1
9,"This tastes great. I can't say too much about the energy factor, although I should point out that energy drinks don't usually do much for me. It has a very nice mango flavor and doesn't taste like weird chemicals. Try it!",1
11,"These are a great snack when you're on the go.  Unlike most fruit bars, they have a bit of fiber in them, making them far healthier and longer lasting.",1
13,"I've found this to be a good sweetener. I have to use more than they say (about 10 drops when I'm using lemon), but I use extra packet sweetener, too. Very happy. I'll just have to figure out how many ""servings"" I get from a bottle, but I'm guessing it's more economical than the stevia products I get at the grocery store.",1
16,"I found out about these from a co-worker. They are delicious, low calorie, and pack some protein. Eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down. I get them by the case now from Amazon since it is a better buy (and my supermarket doesn't always carry them).",1
23,"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it.",1
24,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.",1
28,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also.",1
36,"I can't believe I didn't check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you don't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us.",1
41,"I have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same, they taste like protein bars. This is my favorite because it tastes like eating a normal chocolate waffer candy bar. Chocolate is my favorite, followed by peanut butter. Great for a snack, I take one with me when I go out with friends so I have a tasty healthy treat.",1
48,This is probably the best tasting zero calorie flavored water Ive ever had. Becareful though this does have sugar alcohol in it and if you have too much it can cause bowel discomfort.,1
55,"I have been using this for a year now, very good in tea, I use it on anything. My son puts it on his cereal, he is a very picky eater and he has no clue it isn't real sugar. I put it on my pancakes....Yuuuuummyyyy",1
56,"Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you'll like it.",1
62,"I love this drink. Squeeze a bit into water, lemonade , or club soda. This tastes great. I found it to have a fruit taste a little sweet, and the best part you do not have to use a lot. I found it out to be  better then the Mio. Fits in my bag, no more pricey drinks at stores no more. A few drops and I have a refreshing drink. Everyone in my family really enjoyed it as well.",1
65,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.",1
66,These are fantastic! They are a good price for what you get. I made sugar cookies and the kids drew on them.,1
69,I chose this product as I am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products. This goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry. It keeps me full till lunch time. I worry about the fat content however. I probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that.,1
71,This is the second time I have purchased this item. No sugar added taste like regular chocolate not like sugar free which is awful. Good night time drink before bed,1
79,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.",1
81,"Great quality, great price!  I'm using this after my workouts instead of sugary Gatorade or similar.  You can even mix in some whey powder after resistance training for an added protein boost -- tastes great.  Organic too... this is the best deal I've found on coconut water so far.",1
84,I have been eating Medifast meals for a year.  Medifast changed the recipe to their pretzels and they were not as good. To my surprise the cinnamon pretzel that Kay's is a good if not better than Medifast and cost have the price.  The calories and protein were important factor and are pretty much the same based on ounces.,1
92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.",1
122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.  I wouldn't hesitate to have one of these as an occasional treat.",1
126,While it is a bit pricey. I enjoyed this water as a nice alternative to just plain water. I enjoyed the flavoring of the Watermelon. It made it easier to make sure that I am hydrated.,1
129,"As far as cookies go, this isn't going to ruin your diet (much) and it's pretty tasty too!  Three cookies, and they aren't tiny cookies either, are 140 calories.  There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called ""cookies"" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!  Sulfur gives me hives anyway.  As of right now, these are $18.22 per package for 4 packages of 10 servings each.  I'm hoping these become subscribe & save items.  These are good & I will probably get them again.",1
137,"I have ordered these types of chocolates before(Weinbrand Bohnen Brandy Chocolates) and these were fantastic, they had great flavor,were very fresh(sometimes they dry up if they are older),and were the perfect size(some larger ones are too big and the liquid can run if not all in your mouth),the chocolate as well as the brandy were of high quality and very tasty... Also the price was great for as many that were in the package... I ordered these very close to the holiday and they arrived earlier than expected!",1
138,"How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!",1
141,I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.,1
144,These are very delish - crunchy & flavorful - easy to transport for kids lunches and helps provide the daily requirements for fruit.,1
145,"I'm always looking for a good energy drink, that will give me a boost, but not a big let down.  I like the glaceau energy water.  This is a good alternative.  This makes 24 8-ounce servings, at $6 a bottle it's only 25 cents a glass vs $1.50 or so for the vitamin water by glaceau or others found in the supermarkets and  convenience stores.   The flavor is like a light fruit punch. You can control how much you want to add to your water for taste.  It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium.  It has about the same amount of caffeine as a can of soda, so not too much, no jittery feeling after drinking it.   It is good to get healthy vitamins while I'm drinking water and not just sugar and caffeine from sodas.",1
147,Dr. Smoothie Crushed Fruit is great tasting and easy to make up with other foods that you like. I like the fact that it only contains fruit and no other chemicals or additives since I am allergic to a lot of food.,1
153,"I would like to share with you who are contemplating Mr. Trivedi's products, I was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux. I was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no,s.  About 3 months ago I found out about this incredible water, since then that is all I drink.  I had the most amazing results, not only easing my acid reflux,but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which I am not especially noted for.  At the 11-11-11 retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in Soho, she remarked how different and calmer I was compared to 2 months ago. I know there will always be skeptics, I am ready for them.  Thank you, Mr. Trivedi",1
159,"Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.  I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.  This is good stuff...get some.",1
162,"I've tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the ""5 hour energy"" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.  I can't say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad/flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think I'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one.",1
170,"We tend to eat these straight and/or with hummus as a chip substitute. I've noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps. I prefer them when they're a bit firmer, but they're still nice even when they're softer than I would like.",1
175,"I like to eat these for breakfast or in between meals for a quick healthy snack. I like the almonds and flax included in these bars. The texture is really nice, a little chewy, but a little crunchy. There  is a good balance of complex carbs and proteins to give me enough energy to get to my next meal. These are not too sweet. There are no chemicals or artificial ingredients in these. Give them a try.",1
178,This product is absolutely delightful. They are better than chocolate to me and one taste and you are hooked!,1
191,"This makes some great baked goods! I'm no baking expert but I can follow a recipe pretty well. So far I've used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles. I think people are right and saying that you should scale down the amount of vanilla needed. I've been using exactly what was on the recipe and I get just a slight alcohol aftertaste. If you smell the vanilla right out of the bottle, it is clear it's the vanilla you are tasting. It's not unpleasant and I don't think anybody would really notice.",1
196,"The sweet tea flavor is very tasty and refreshing without any added sugar or calories.  It is very conveniently packaged for use away from home as well.  I just pop it in my purse and I'm good-to-go.  I get to control how much flavor is added according to my taste and mood.  Because it is a liquid, there is no concern with additive powders that don't dissolve properly.  I'm a fan.",1
213,"No aftertaste, isn't overpowering, doesn't mask the flavor of the food. We use this on our steel cut oats and protein drinks, no bitter aftertaste like the powders.",1
225,"I really wanted to get a chocolate syrup for my sons to make chocolate milk with but hated buying hersheys because of the HFCS and other ingredients. Being in Alaska options were zero. So I ordered this off amazon in a 4 pack to save money hoping it was good and it is! We keep ours in the fridge, so maybe that's why, but it takes a few extra stirs to get it mixed well. But the flavor is great and I can rest at ease knowing (even though it's still sugary) at least it is organic and natural.",1
226,I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.  The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.  If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.,1
227,Very tasty product..good for you and tastes good..great combo.  I love it over the top of vanilla yogurt..yummmy,1
228,"The Switch Watermelon/Strawberry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 35 grams of sugar and 36 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 140 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.  Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion.",1
240,"These crunchy snacks are healthy, addictive, and tasty. I love the crisp texture, the flavors, and the perfect size for a snack. Much better than the Apple Chips that have all that added junk and sugar. These Sensible Foods Snacks are just dried fruit! Love the apple harvest flavor best, then tropical blend. A favorite snack item!",1
247,"Generally speaking, I really like mini wheats, so this cereal was appealing to me already.  I enjoyed the flavor very much since it didn't taste artificial.  I also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup.  It gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat.  My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.  It is hard to measure 47 pieces (serving size) so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for.  Overall, the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy.  I'm looking forward to buying some more.",1
256,"One of the only apple drink mixes I found that tastes good. I used to buy the Walmart brand apple drink, but that tasted too fake for my taste. This one contains some sugar so it has some calories, but taste wise it's like light apple juice with a hint of artificial flavoring.",1
262,"Received these in my Influenster box for Summer, taste great and very soft. Seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost.",1
265,licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice,1
271,"Very tasty.  It's hard to find something which has as much protein (6g) as sugars (6g).  I just wish that the sugars were really sugar instead of corn syrup; also, it would taste even better (in my opinion) if it had 2/3 as much sugar.  but still the best snack bar out there.",1
273,This a delicious Grape Juice.It is good for anytime of the day and it is healthy for you and your children. I highly recommend this for all kids and adults.Please try this out.,1
275,"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot.",1
276,"Fiber one products actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this product is for you.",1
293,"For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down. All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with. Avoid it.",1
306,"It is great to be able to get a healthy snack in the mail here in Afghanistan!  Appreciated that the mango has not additives or preservatives, just natural and delicious.  Thanks!",1
307,"You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.  I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.  I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all. If you like it, go ahead and order one of the regular-salted  Kraepelien & Holm Farm Salt Licorice, 2.2-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)  available on Amazon, making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer. Otherwise, you risk wasting your money on something you may consider inedible.",1
327,This liquid vitamin is pretty tasty. I thought it made my water taste like watered down Crystal Light. My kids also liked that it made their water turn pink and gave it a faint sweet taste.  It's not overwhelming in sweetness or vitamin in taste. I could not detect the vitamins at all. The only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening.,1
342,"We all enjoyed these very chocolatey cookies!  They have a nice chewy texture and gooey center which complement each other well.  They may not be homemade, but they were still great with a glass of milk!",1
364,"Great simple snacks for those who are watching calories. At 100 calories a bar, these have an amazing blueberry flavor and all natural texture. There is no doubt that these will get you through your hunger to your next meal without packing on the pounds. These bars are a step up in the granola/breakfast/snack bar catagory. Highly reccomended!",1
368,"Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I don't drink hot chocolate that often and I'm from America and don't think I've ever had hot chocolate while traveling in Europe, BUT my husband is a British citizen who grew up in India with summers in England and he has searched HIGH and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood.  We found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now (not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that I bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them... men).",1
392,"I wanted something to fill the new flask I just bought so I scoured the whiskey aisle and this product caught my eye.  Boy am I glad it did.  After one bottle shared with friends over the weekend, I am ready for more.  My new favorite.  I do admit with others that it is a bit sweet but hey, what did you expect from maple syrup?  Try it, you won't be disappointed.",1
394,These are okay.  I love their Gummi Bears so I thought I'd add to my On-the-road snacks.,1
399,"So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.  The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too.",1
400,These are my favorites and I have reordered more than once.  Perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good.  Cant find these locally so go to Amazon for my candy fix.,1
414,"Really quenches your thirst, but you need to like seltzer water; I do. Top of the line.",1
417,"This was their first product.  It is filtered, hence the clear color, and while doesnt have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product, for taste, it can't be beat. I would recommend to those trying to get off soft drinks and something (marginally) better.",1
422,this is an ideal bar for someone that wants the taste of a nutty candybar but with 30grams of protein! Tastes like a Payday. High fat and sugar content are the downsides though.,1
426,"These are excellent, don't taste sugar free at all. They taste just like the regular version and they are sweetened with Splenda with no chemical sweeteners. They're a little pricey but make a good treat.",1
429,"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.  I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.  The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.  The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.  I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough.",1
441,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.  I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others.",1
446,I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...IT'S A RIP-OFF!,1
448,"I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste.",1
450,I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t,1
453,"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit.",1
454,I love this dressing! It has such a good fruity flavor! I've already recommended it to friends!,1
460,"For those of you who like/love black licorice, I seriously recommend this product.  i eat it because I love black licorice, and only recently found that what I have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well.  These is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation.  It comes in other flavors too, but the medicinal effects only come the black.",1
461,"These cookies aren't like the traditional Fig Newtons/Fruit Newtonss I have bought in the past.  They look more like a thin cracker.  The cookies are also crunchy like a cracker, but definitely not as dry.  They are sweet but not too sweet, and very blueberry.  They remind me of the very top of a blueberry muffin, which is a good thing!  I'll definitely buy more of these for my family.",1
462,"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.  These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies.",1
465,"I bought this Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water for my husband. He loves it! He tryed all different kind of coconut drinks, but there were with some preservatives and other junks (there were not tasty at all). This one taste great and is healthy!",1
476,"I grew up eating Red Vines and I liked them very much, but it's been ages and ages since I've eaten licorice. I don't why, I do eat candy on occasion, but licorice I just stopped eating, until last week when I tried these. They do kind of remind me of Red Vines. The flavor is different, of course, then I remember. These are pomegranate flavored, but it's been ages and ages plus years since I've eaten a pomegranate, so I can't swear that they've gotten the flavor right, but that being said, these are very tasty.",1
477,"My daughter started eating these while she was 8month and loved them. They melt really fast in your mouth and they taste very good. Its not sweet but its not tasteless, it has a very creamy/milk texture to it.",1
479,I'm constantly using the glaze on everything and I really do like the taste and consistency. I was trying to find a replacement for the glaze Williams and Sonoma sells and this happened to be very close and for a better price.,1
487,"This is a great snack! It tastes great and it's healthy and tasty --a nice alternative to nuts and dried fruits--perfect for tossing into a backpack before a hike, watching the game, or for an on-the-go snack. The 8-packs will tide me over until there's a family-size pack available.",1
490,This is a great price for Grade B maple.  I bought it for the Lemonade Diet and found it to be good to the last drop!,1
503,"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,  What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.  If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!  So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!",1
524,"This one by far is my favorite as far as taste is concerned.  I use this as a snack to get me through to my next actual meal.  There is a good amount of fiber, low in sugar and very few net carbs.  I really like the taste too.",1
529,"I really like this Licorice.  It has a great flavor.  Does it taste like Pomegranate?  I don't really know what a pomegranate is supposed to taste like, so can't really answer if that's the flavor I'm tasting.  But if you're looking for a licorice with a nice berry flavor that doesn't turn your tongue colors, this is it.  I also like that it's from Newman's Own.  I always purchase their products as I know it's going towards charity.",1
538,"This 100% whole grain is very tasty.  The clusters are small enough you can toss it into yogurt or eat as a cereal, but they are also large enough you can eat them as a snack.  Lightly sweet, full of texture and cholesterol free, these blueberry vanilla clusters are very healthy.  With a high source of fiber, 750mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grain, you can feel good about eating this.  It's very economical and convenient.  I look forward to trying other flavors!",1
540,"These banana nut bars are soft and chewy, with a nice banana bread flavor. They go great with a cup of coffee for a quick, light breakfast or an afternoon snack.",1
557,"If this is as healthy as it is tasty then a great product.  A little pricey for only 15 servings, but that Organic Red Dutch Cocoa is delectable.",1
581,"This is a mix of apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juices.  Taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews. I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.  The tangerine is the dominant flavor. However it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or, perhaps, a clementine. There is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor. I could see people not liking it while other do.  Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else. These aren't nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isn't necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda. On some level (e.g. producing fruit instead of sugar cane) it might be attractive to some.",1
583,"So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december.",1
589,"These can be hard to find, and taste GREAT- so good that Amazon can deliver them so I dont have to worry about finding them or running out! Packed with protein and NO SUGAR! Check out [...] for more details!",1
592,"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck",1
610,"This is my husband's FAVORITE soda. Has a mild fruity flavor similar to Manzanita Sol, tastes like a little bit of heaven. I can't find any stores in my area that sell it but I have had good experiences buying it off Amazon. Just remember when you are buying to pay attention to the shipping weight as some of the distributors use a mass picture of a 12 pack but will actually be selling a 1.5 litre. Shipping weight for a 12 pack should be around 10lbs. Oh and Guarana comes in many flavors, but Guarana Antarctica is usually the most popular/favorite.",1
617,Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate.,1
624,"I think these taste pretty good. There are lots of nuts & and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies. You get 54 cookies for the price, so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it.",1
626,You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.  The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!,1
632,"Our kids love them and I've been known to sneak a few here and there too.  All natural/organic ingredients, names you can pronounce and know what these are made out of, no hydrogentated oils or high fructose corn syrup.  It's nice to have the variety of flavours too.",1
637,Please stay away from artificial sweetners.  Some of them actually change the shape of human cells.  this has an artificial sweetner,1
641,"This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.  I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.  For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.  Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans.",1
647,"Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup. Using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet, and still too weak in the chocolate department. It uses sucralose as a sweetener, which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor. This may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or don't mind the taste of sucralose. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people.",1
649,"the dried blue berry are a little chewy but they taste great. I add them to my Special K in the morning. And talk about a great BM, this will do it. In fact if you eat to much... well never mind, just dont east to much without eating a bunch of cheese afterwards.",1
656,I am on my third or fourth bottle.  Am not sure how well the health benefits are working out but I really like it because it adds flavor to different drinks.  I usually add a little bit to my orange juice or water once a day to give it a nice flavor. It probably taste good because it's mostly concentrated pomegranate juice.,1
661,These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!,1
665,"These are by no means low-cal, but they have 20 g protein and taste really good, better than a lot of the vitamin-tasting bars I've had.  They are huge, so I half it and eat one half now and the other later on or another day.  I'm eager to try the triple chocolate flavor.  The sugar grams is 38 per bar...that's why I only eat half at a time.  Fiber is just 2 grams per bar.",1
673,"Got this shipped to the office and have been eating it for breakfast.  Its healthy, its tasty, and its cheap.  Beat that...",1
674,"I was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out. I love almonds and I love chocolate. And most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both, without the extra sugar. Well there's definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing - it tastes pretty bad to me. And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it. So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again! This is really just cocoa and almond, and, for me, that left a very bad taste.",1
675,"It does not taste like pure coconut water,Its taste like some drink with coconut flavour. I wouldn't prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs. they taste better than these bottled drink.",1
686,"I liked this bar.  It had a good balance of flavor and wasn't overly sweet.  I would have preferred that there was a bit more protein in it, but it works as a ""snack"" bar.",1
688,"I'm utterly baffled by the positive reviews for this product.  Now I've been using Stevia for the past year to sweeten my coffee. I have no issue with the Stevia.  I used to drink a lot of soda, and then a few years back, a lot of diet soda. Since then, I've been able to give up soda altogether. But my Dad who is diabetic, is absolutely obsessed with diet coke. I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.  Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.  So disappointing. :(",1
691,"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!  Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.",1
693,"These candies are small which I like since I don't want to scarf down a candy bar that has 300 calories. These candies are about 15 calories each. The flavor is a mix between coffee and cream, which you already know, but the sugar content is not so large as to make you feel the candies are nothing but sugar. You can eat 8 of these candies a day and have no guilt. The hardness of the candies is great because they last awhile and unlike other candies they don't stick to your teeth and torture you for 20 minutes. Geeh, I'm sounding old! But I can't buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories, so these candies seem to be ideal.",1
697,"If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a ""super bar"" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.",1
701,I had a variety of granola. And this one ranks of my top most favorites. It is a very crunch granola with a coconut main taste. It is sweet but not overly so. I eat at as a snack when im craving something. Fills you up very fast and satisfies any sugar cravings.,1
703,I was amazed at the actual taste of this product . . . the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good.  They have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good.,1
720,"these little cookies taste fantastic! not too sweet, just right....chocolate melts easily, so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only",1
721,"Honeysuckle Pear is one of three flavors of Drink Chia. I personally like the Strawberry and Mango more, but this one still tastes good. Some of my friends like this one more than the others. They only have 40 calories and 4 grams of sugar, and contain lots of Omega 3 (880mg!!), Omega 6, iron, potassium, calcium, fiber, protein, magnesium...they are extremely healthy.  This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink. The seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water, so when you drink them they hold onto it, keeping you hydrated longer. Great for workouts and sports. It's all in an 8oz bottle so it's easy to carry in a bag or in your hand wherever you go.",1
725,"These taste great. Very sweet and flavorful without the aftertaste of conventional candies. 10 lbs requires a bit of a financial investment but it's a great value if you're a ""natural"" candy lover. This comes shipped in a plastic bag so I recommend getting a plastic tub or a using an old popcorn tin for storage (2 gallon size or thereabouts).",1
726,very cherry tasting- reminds me of cherry popsicles. with the addition of vitamins it's a great alternative to juices and sodas. it's very dark red so be careful of stains,1
732,These are a great alternative to high calorie snacks - great with salsa or any type of dip.  Also great as a side with soup.,1
737,"This is a chocolate donut flavored coffee. It is not pre sweetened, has a great aroma and flavor. It is perfect for someone who likes it dark or likes to add cream and or sugar on his or her own. I have tried other flavors like this and this one is by far the best.",1
749,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!"".",1
754,I mix it with apple juice and throw a cup of honey nut cheerios into a blender with it and it taste fantastic. Love the product and planning on buying the 3 pound bag every time I run out!,1
757,"This stuff is good, and I mean REALLY good. My husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame, a known neurological toxin, and I wanted to provide a much safer alternative. I found this at PCC and he loved it. I can't STAND the taste of artificially sweetened things and I usually end up with a nasty migraine, and this didn't bother me one bit. The taste is fantastic in my opinion, but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate, which is why I would recommend picking up a 6 pack at the market before ordering a pack of 24.",1
758,"I really enjoy these bars, I usually will have 1/4 to 1/2 of bar at a time, gives me energy until next meal, love the taste and crunch.  :)",1
759,"4 Stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildren's rating of 5 stars.  I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks. The can I was sent contained 8.3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  For children, this is a tasty and healthy alternative.",1
762,"I love eating these apple chips.  I tried ""Good Health Original Apple Crisps"" (these are the ones in the Fuji Apple salad sold at Panera Bread) and while yummy, they are fried and have more calories.  This particular variety by Bare Fruit is baked and has less than 60cal/serving so I consider this a win-win.",1
772,"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing. I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices. Enjoy!",1
785,The stuff is great but I'll pay at most $4 or $5 for four bottles.,1
794,"This product is sweetened with Splenda, and tastes very artificial. Maybe if you like diet soda you will like this, but the 3 people that sampled it did not.",1
796,"These are extremely tasty! A nice sweet fresh taste. I felt like I was eating healthy candy. They're pretty crunchy, too, rather than chewey, which is a nice change from a lot of energy bars. (I'm getting sick of most kinds..) This may be my new favorite. I wish Amazon had the 1.7oz 230 calorie bars that I got, they're a better size for taking on hikes and stuff!",1
799,"This is an INCREDIBLE product. It's natural sweeteners make it so tasty! I can eat half the bag in one sitting and not feel bad! It's the perfect snack, with yogurt, milk, or frozen yogurt!!! Thank you BNF for making a tasty, health-conscious treat!",1
803,"These bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly. If you factor in the weight to calorie ratio, they are about the same,(ratio wise),to Nature Valley bars. The Amazon or Quaker description says 5.5 ozs. However each bar is only 0.91 ozs. The whole package of 6 weigh 5.5 oz. But I did give them 4 stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry. One would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious.",1
809,I had a friend from Canada who always used to send these to me.  But unfortunately she moved and could no longer send them to me.  These taste just like the ones I used to get.  They are my candy bars!!,1
811,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)  Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",1
813,These little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious.  Being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor.  The fruit tastes freshly ripened but not mushy.  Each serving is perfect for one person and can be taken to work or where ever without a problem.  The price for each pack of 36 is good too (for now anyway).  I highly recommend these little (just 4 ounces) fruit cups.,1
814,"I started looking online for a milk alternative since I'm in college, need breakfast, and don't want to pay $4.50 for a half gallon of milk. I decided on Saco after reading reviews, and this stuff rocks. It tastes better, drinks fresher, and doesn't give me gas in the least bit. I'm never buying store milk again.",1
816,"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed.",1
818,I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.,1
819,"Is this the healthiest breakfast?  No.  Of course not.  But does it taste great?  YES!  I have a 45-minute commute, and drinking my chocolate protein shake makes the drive much more enjoyable, and cuts down on my getting-ready time in the morning at home.  I have one for breakfast every day, and my husband has one for lunch every day.  We love them!  I prefer the chocolate, and my husband drinks the vanilla and strawberry.  Neither of us love the dark chocolate.  Definitely try these!",1
820,"I realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12-16 oz. canisters of liquid at a sitting, but this Switch Orange Tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing, and tasted so natural, that I could easily have downed another 8.3 oz can - or two. And that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars - I wanted more and the little can was just not enough! It is the perfect size for a child, however - so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for. As an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult-oriented, this Orange Tangerine Switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka - cheers!",1
822,"These cookies are Quaker baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking.",1
823,Acai is one of the most powerful superfoods. I take a shot daily and have noticed increased energy levels and improved digestion.,1
824,"Soft, flavorful and fun; I feel a little goofy eating these 30 inch long Fruit Rolls - but they do taste great!",1
832,"These bars are a perfect, healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth. They're moisty, chewy, and just sweet enough. They don't contain corn syrup and you won't miss the wheat or dairy.",1
851,We love these pecans! The citrus and pepper and sweet taste is so yummy.  We can't get enough of these and we think they make a great snack.  They're also very good on a salad.,1
866,"I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange/tangerine flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Kiwi Strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well.",1
870,Special K bar is a quick fix to a sweet tooth without a lot of calories involved.,1
878,I really enjoyed this drink. The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. This drink is 100% natural and has no sugar added. The carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one.  I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda.,1
880,"This stuff is delicious!  The flavor tastes like a combination of grape juice and cranberry juice.  It has just the right amounts of sweetness and tartness.  The size of each packet makes it perfect for adding to a bottle of spring water, or a bottle of filtered water from home.  The little ""stix"" are very convenient and easy to open.  Best of all, it has no sugar, no carbs, and no calories.  A great way to jazz up your water without messing up your diet.",1
893,"Tried all 3 'crunch' bars .... was pleasantly surprised with taste of each; not as filling as the high protein think thin bars but good for light snack.  Very nutty, sweet.  A keeper.",1
900,"It tastes pretty good. I mix it in a single-serve blender with water, chia seeds (that's been soaking in the water for 30 min), a banana, an apple and sometimes frozen mixed berries.  Don't mix it with coconut water. I tried that and it tasted horrible.  I bought this at first at Whole Foods but Amazon is MUCH cheaper, especially with the subscription program.",1
905,It's somewhat hard to find a Macadamia Syrup but I happen to love this particular flavor.  My first order off Amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so I gave this one a try and I'm happy I did!  It's quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch.  There are quite a few servings in each bottle and it's perfect for Italian Soda.  Also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit.,1
910,"I'm not sure about the claims that sour sop kills cancer cells, but I'm hoping it does.  Even if it doesn't, it is a great tasting drink.  I'm sure it has health benefits, too.",1
913,"I'm never a big fan of any kind of cold cereal. I bought this cereal only because I need some quick/easy food that's also healthy. Wow I was so surprised. This is the most tasty cereal that I have ever had! It definitely doesn't taste as boring as the usual ""healthy"" products and it is indeed healthy! Eating cereal is fun now. I'm so glad that I gave it a try. Will definitely buy more.",1
917,This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.,1
920,This Cinnamone Hot Chocolate is the best. We get it every year around Christmas time and enjoy the holiday movies with a cup of this hot chocolate. You can not go wrong getting this hot chocolate.,1
921,"My husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar, and they taste great!",1
922,"I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a ""Kid"" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good.  The first two ingredients are Apple Puree and Apple Juice, and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins & minerals (plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure).  Yes I know, these are full of sugar - apple juice concentrate is another way of saying ""sugar - apple flavored"".  But as far as a sugary treat goes, this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside.  It's tasty and I get my candy craving out of the way.  It's mostly organic, so I don't have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment.  Maybe a real apple is better for you, but this will do in a pinch.",1
926,"I would recommend this tea, it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that I have not had before.  It also gave me energy which I can always use!",1
934,"i love the flavor and taste of these bars.  the multigrain is made up of oats and barley, giving the crust a fresh taste and not crumbly.  the triple berries is a nice blend and there is not one overwhelming flavor between the crust and berries.  150 calories, 29g of carbs.  it is a tasty and filling bar.  highly recommended for a breakfast treat along with a good cup of coffee!",1
939,"I've been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks.  After tasting many different products, this one is my favorite by a long shot.  I can't believe it has no sugar at all.  The little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage.  Some of the other brands I have tried gave me heartburn or they weren't sweet enough.  This one is perfect.  I tried the cherry flavor also which is good, but not as good as the tropical.  You have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain, but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet, clothes, and countertops.  Ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead.  Cutting calories just became a lot more easy!  Edit:  I still use this product multiple times a day.  It's great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great, and you don't have to worry about calorie intake, or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars.  I also took 2 packets on vacation and mixed it on site.  Saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip.  I just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well.",1
943,I have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts. I ordered this because we couldn't fool the kids with our local alternative (Sunbutter). I had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it wasn't peanut butter. I ordered this without putting much hope into it as I've tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos. I was pleasantly suprized when I served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn't the real thing. I'm glad I ordered such a large quantity. I will be using this from now one. It is by far the best alternative out there.  A HUGE bonus is the fact that there aren't a bunch of additives.  Anything that uses Cane Sugar and Sea Salt always sit better with me anyway. Great product!,1
949,"These ""Whenever Bars"" taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.  Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still, it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.  I eat them around mid-morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten, wheat, or dairy (these bars are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats, agave, chia seeds, brown rice flour, etc.  Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat.",1
955,Since I am counting calories I find Wasa crisp'n light very tasty. You can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. I think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them.,1
959,"Tastes great.  Good price.  I eat them after lunch when I'm craving something sweet.  Donuts and pastries mess up your diet, but these are great to get the sugar you crave in a low calorie treat.  I get them through subscribe and save, best way to go.",1
965,"I purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch.  The texture is a bit hard (moat if not all protein bars are hard) but these Special K Protein Bars tastes great!  With 10 grams of protein per bar, it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there.  I only have other protein bars that I use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these Special K bars tastes the best to me.  I will be buying more!",1
969,I really like the Pamelas Products Whenever bars. They have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great. Only 8 grams of sugar. It is filling and I would order these in the future.,1
971,"This cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten-free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor. I really liked the fact that it is a high-protein cereal, which helps to control blood sugar levels.",1
988,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.  The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.  However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.",1
992,"I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I don't get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients. Another thumbs down---they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle-aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned---vitamin K can cause blood clots. HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies!",1
995,"Loved this drink. The sweetness level was just right, and I really liked the fact this is 100% juice without corn syrup or refined sugar. I didn't really think the watermelon strawberry tasted like watermelon or strawberry, but it was a really nice, pleasant flavor. The carbonation was just right. I also liked that this drink didn't leave a weird aftertaste or a lingering flavor on the tongue like some other sodas or juice drinks. This had a very clean flavor that was very refreshing.",1
1001,"Baby loves this and so do I. It's very tasty and great for breakfast or lunch. One of our favorite banana combos, but the beet comes through and of course the blueberry just adds a little something extra. Highly recommend.",1
1021,"These are the best lollipops I've ever had!  Sadly, they are not available via Amazon directly at the moment, so no ""guaranteed"" flavor ratios.  The bag I got was:  65 Strawberry Smash 60 Tart Sour Apple 39 Googly Grape 35 Tooberry Blueberry 33 Wet-faced Watermelon 32 Mango Tango 30 Pomegranate Pucker 28 Very Very Cherry 1 Mango (no Tango; was only one of the colors ;) ...)  So, a total of 323, pretty close to ""as advertised"".  I was surprisingly fond of flavors such as the strawberry and watermelon, which I generally don't like in other candies (artificially flavored ones).  However, the blueberry and mango fell a bit flat.  In general, though, these are the best approximations to real fruit flavors I've come across in hard candy before.  Hope the trick-or-treaters enjoy them as well!",1
1023,"I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list, DO NOT BUY IT!!",1
1024,"Wow, how do they pack all that sweetness and flavor into just a few drops? I just tried it in my coffee and I was very surprised. This is great stuff and such a blessing for the diabetics out there like myself.",1
1030,"I love regular merengue cookies and I normally don't have a problem with sugar free, but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture.  Stick to the non sugar-free.",1
1033,"If these are as nutritious as they are tasty, it's a fabulous alternative to real apples. These are NOT the fully-dried apples you may have had. They are partially dehydrated, with a nice chewy texture. They are a little tart, but I'm not sure if that is the apples or the sulfur dioxide. It's a pleasant tart, in any event. Hope sulfur dioxide isn't a dangerous ingredient, as it's all there is except apples. Quality of the source fruit is excellent - no core, seeds, skin or other ""bad"" bites.  I should also mention that this is a rather large serving. I snack on these in my office, and one bag serves as about four 120-calorie snacks for me. So it's a much better buy than it might appear.",1
1045,I like the taste of this chocolate milk.  It's not too sweet and the size is perfect to take to work and have it as my breakfast.  --new The design of this container is terrible for toddlers.  Opening from the top fits the straw perfectly but this is bad.  When my daughter drinks it she would try really hard to suck on the straw. When the air is gone and container is flat she would squeese it trying to get more milk.,1
1053,"Not only are these organic purees healthy, they are actually pretty tasty. Our baby devours these on their own or mixed with other foods. The packaging is very convenient for meals at home or on the go. Even my adult palate was pleased with the little taste I had. The only potential negative is that they're a little on the pricey side.",1
1059,My husband loves these granola bars.  He uses them to satisfy his sweet tooth and his chocolate cravings and I don't mind because they're a lot better than eating a candy bar.  The price is a decent savings from what I've seen in stores but I haven't been able to find this particular kind locally anymore so I'll continue to buy from here.,1
1061,"This have been a huge hit with the whole family.  They remind me of a tea cracker more than a cookie or anything ""Newton"".  They aren't overly sweet and have a subtle orange and cranberry flavor.  The cranberries can be a bit chewy but add to the overall texture of the cookies.  They also travel well and are great cookies for lunch boxes and toddlers!",1
1067,"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.  The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.  This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it.",1
1069,"Here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar. Even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar. This allows you to have a drink option (other than water) with a perky taste that is low calorie and sugar free.  Parents dont tell the kids and just serve it, they will never know the diffrence. Its that good",1
1093,I bought a box of these as a special.  Sure glad I bought when I did as the price went up drastically.  I love raspberries and wanted to try dark chocolate over milk chocolate.  These taste excellent!  I consider them a treat after dinner as if I was eating one of those very expensive chocolates but for much less the cost.  They are small enough that I don't feel like I am packing away pounds by eating one or two yet are very flavorful in a small candy.  I would buy again but having 430 of them I have enough for awhile.  Will probably take some to work to share with the group.,1
1101,You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.,1
1104,The CHocorooms are so good and tasty with no cholesterol!!!  The kids love them and they are a perfect size for them to think they are getting a lot of sweets.,1
1107,"I like Lance products but I wasn't sure how these would be received. Both kids loved them, they have a good texture and taste. Great change from chewy granola bars or cookies. Lance packs these with a small stiff liner so they generally survive in the lunch box without shattering. Definitely buying again.",1
1110,"The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.",1
1115,"As a hot drink, this made a great alternative to tea.  It's spicy and somehow refreshing.  It tastes mostly natural, and it's said to be, but I did not have retail packaging - nor are the ingredients listed online - so I have no idea what is actually in the product, and I would want to know for sure before buying very much of it.  I also would like to try it in carbonated water to see if one can make a more naural, less sugary ginger-ale.",1
1126,"I really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them.  The only thing I would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered, they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them.",1
1130,"I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways. I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a ""hot plastic-y"" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.",1
1140,"Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.  Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda.",1
1141,"I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.  1.  IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)  2.

1156,"For a chocolate chip cookie, this is a tasty product. But for a source of protein at the same calorie count as a candy bar, this cookie tastes ridiculously good.",1
1159,"If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).  The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!",1
1162,"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as ""all-natural"" but had ingredients like ""natural flavors and colors"". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink.",1
1167,I've used this BBQ sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives (like corn syrup and for us gluten) but the price on this can't be right.  Order directly from the Daddy Sam's website to pay $5.50/19 oz bottle.  This price would HAVE to be a case price although the description says 19oz.,1
1188,I happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. Very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away.,1
1192,"Since visiting Hawaii, I have fallen in love with Passion Fruit Juice.  This flavor is hard to find, even in California.  Often other tropical flavors are mixed in.  This tastes exactly like I expected it too.  It is very concentrated.  I am happy with about an ounce in a 20 ounce bottle.  I add water, ice and Splenda to taste.  The directions say to mix the 16.9 ounce bottle with 8 more bottles of water = makes over a gallon.  As far as I can tell, it is unsweetened.  It does contain some preservatives including cirtic acid, sodium bezoate and metabisulphite.  This comes from Brazil.  Great product!! I use it for juice, to flavor Greek yogurt, and to add to a white or yellow cake for a tropical flavor.  You can also make a great pie.  Follow your favorite lemon chiffon recipe, and use this instead of the lemon juice.  I will be buying more.  I bought 4 bottles = same shipping cost as one bottle!!!",1
1198,"First off, I love these Torani sugar free syrups, it's a great no calorie way to sweeten and add flavor to your coffee.  I purchased my first bottle locally in a gourmet shop, for about $13.  Buying the three pack on amazon is like getting a bottle for free.  FYI, bottles from amazon are plastic, which I don't mind at all - less likely I'll break them while stumbling through my morning routine.  :)  Great price, fast delivery.",1
1203,"I just found PB2 and PB2 with chocolate and I am thrilled.  I love sugary goodies but I'm not a fan of calories and I don't like chocolate.  I thought I'd try PB2 with chocolate anyway and I'm so glad I did!  Eating a serving or two of PB2 with chocolate satisfies my sweet craving without breaking my calorie bank!  Sometimes, when I want to splurge, I spread some PB2 with chocolate on a graham cracker, spread some marshmallow fluff on another and sandwich them together! YUM!",1
1209,My kids love these and I love giving them a treat that is not full of artificial junk. I have also tried them and they are very good.,1
1211,"I really like the fruity taste of this tea - so much so that I can actually drink it without sugar.  If you like fruity teas, you should try this product.",1
1214,"These are great tasting bars. I could eat them all day, but the problem is that they are not filling at all. You eat one and it doesn't feel like you ate anything at all, which is why I have to give it 4 stars instead of one.",1
1223,"It's Crunchy, I'm now love the smoother Nana's Like  Nana's No Gluten Lemon Cookie, 3.5-Ounce Cookies (Pack of 12)  or  Nana's No Gluten Chocolate Cookie, 3.5-Ounces (Pack of 12)  you get the idea I hope!! I don't have coffee or Chocolate anymore! If you don't have a problem GREAT but I found out I do!!",1
1228,"I love the taste of Total, and it's good for you!  Even my kids love it :)",1
1235,"We picked some of these up this week. They're very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you're walking out the door. The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.  On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.  When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.  I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet. Anyway, they are tasty and I'd recommend.",1
1238,"My husband and I both reach for these any time we need a little snack. They are tasty, have only healthy ingredients. Best of all we can eat several as the calorie count for them is 22 per large cracker!!  We have even taken them on vacations as they weigh next to nothing so they add no weight to our luggage.",1
1241,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!",1
1245,This bar was recommended by my strength and conditioning coach.  It tastes great and ingredients are very good.,1
1248,"I have to admit, I liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one, kiwi berry, but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue--it's very clean and refreshing.",1
1249,Very tasty...Our family loves this soda.  I especially like that it's all natural! No HFCS.  It's very light and fruity and not too sweet.  It has a very pleasant light pink color.,1
1250,"I enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda.  It was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it.  I am glad it does not have any HFCS in it, but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars.  All in all, if you are looking for a good orange soda, try this one.",1
1259,"This is simply one of the best low calories food out there. Great taste, low calories, low sugar, high fiber. If you want to eat pasta and don't want to rack up the calories, one answer: FiberGourmet!!!!!",1

1285,"I bought 2 bottles of this Tart Cherry Juice because they were cheaper than TART IS SMART. They may be providing the Anti Oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night. I returned 1 bottle to Amazon & went back to TART IS SMART. I used to wake up 3-4 times a night & have trouble getting back to sleep. Being nearly 80 & retired, I can sleep in if I choose. With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom. This product may work much better for you but I found one that works for me & will stick with it forever. I hope to read YOUR opinion of this product soon?",1
1290,"Fruit-flavored mentos are a delicious candy.  The flavor is teriffic.  Although there are several different colors, they all taste a bit the same to me, which is a general fruit flavor.  I also really enjoy the texture as well.  These mints are chewy on the inside, but on the outside, they have a bit of soft crunchy shell.",1
1291,I LOVE THIS STUFF THE NEWER BOTTLES DONT LOOK LIKE THIS BUT ITS SO FILLING AND DELICIOUS.CARROT JUICE IS MY SUPER FOOD,1
1296,The banana flavor lean body has a great taste! It doesnt have the watered down nutri-sweet taste to it either. I have been very satisfied with the lean body ready to go shakes so far although I havent yet tried all the flavors. My husband usually drinks the pure protien ready to go shakes and he recently got a hold of mine and now he wants me to buy the lean body ones for him because they taste so much better. I told him he cant because they are more expensive then his but I dont think he's going to let me get away with it!,1

1306,"If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch!  My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better.  Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well!",1

1315,I am so glad that Swiss Miss has the K-cup products. I have one every morning as I do not drink coffee :0) Perfect amount of flavor. Not to watery and not to strong.,1
1320,Love the fact you can make as much or as little as you need.  You don't have to open the can and waste 1/2 the can.  They taste just a good as coming out of a can!,1
1321,"I've tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water, though slightly more dilute.  The ""wholesale"" price here doesn't make much sense to me.  It's about $5.75 per liter in an 12 pack.  I get it for $4.99 at Publix.  The only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time, but I'm one of few buying it and I sweep the shelves of it (LOL).   I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.  They should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes (with no renal issues).",1
1325,"If you love chocolate and fruits, this is the product for you. I have just finished my first bag, and I still can't get over the taste. The candies are bite-size, and (even though I hate using cliches) you simply can't get enough of them. The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch. Overall, just like those commercials say, your mouth will thank you.",1
1327,This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste.,1
1329,"These are very tasty, but way too sweet & sugary.  I felt like I was eating candy instead of meat.  If that's okay with you, then you'll probably love these, but I was looking for something a bit healthier.  Yes, I know it says 'sweet' in the product name, but I bought it because of the no hormone, no antibiotic, no artificial ingredient aspect.",1
1331,really bad taste. Not natural at all. We bought a pack but only used one. I wish we hadn't bought it.,1
1334,"If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix.",1
1335,"These bars are a tasty snack.  The taste is like a dry carrot cake.  It is a little chewy, and has a nice texture, with nuts and raisins.  It is surprisingly high in calories, 180 for each bar.",1
1339,"These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love quaker oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat.",1
1343,"I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa.",1
1344,"I tried the banana nut bread soft baked cereal bar and it was so good! If you like banana flavored anything, you will love this. This is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth, it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel. The best part is that is contains protein, B vitamins and fiber. I can't wait to try the cinnamon pecan!",1
1347,Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good,1
1352,I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail.,1
1356,This product tastes better than other coconut juices I have tried. I love that it is not sweetened. I would prefer it come in disposable cartons rather than cans but to me the taste makes it worth purchasing. I like this size also because the larger sizes are too much for me to drink at a time. The size makes it great for lunches and snacks too.,1
1357,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got! Cheers.",1
1360,"Izze is probably the best carbonated beverage that money can buy. Even better than Jones soda. All of Izze's flavors are all natural and taste fantastic. I especially love Sparkling Blackberry. It's worth paying more for the quality, especially since they have fewer calories than soda, and better ingredients. Very tasty and highly recommended.",1
1362,"The variety packs taste great!  I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.  Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.  I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!  Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.  Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...",1
1365,"I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If you've ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.",1
1375,Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.,1
1383,"I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!",1
1385,I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better. There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry,1
1392,I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.  FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.,1
1393,This is very good. I am taking it because I have some gout at the tips of my toes. And I exercise intensely every day. So I want to protect my joints. It's part of my daily health regiment. It's got a good taste but the directions say take two tablespoons for a 6-8 oz glass. Seems too diluted for me so I put 3 tablespoons to a 8oz glass seems to taste better. I haven't tried taking just a tablespoon straight yet.,1
1394,"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.  Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.  Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.  But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.  Overall I am a fan of Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters and would likely buy it in the future.",1
1396,"If your daily water consumption isnt at least 2.2L (for women; 3.3L for men) a day, then it really doesn't matter what kind of water you drink. Work on getting your consumption up to the minimum. If you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day, then picking a water of Atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits. Also, plastic is quite detrimental to your health, so getting an item like Voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag.  Otherwise just buy 1 glass bottle of Voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends. Trust me, no one drinks Voss to impress anyone. People who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it.",1
1399,"I'm on auto and I love my water.  Just wish it was a little bit cheaper, or IF they give discounts or free 6 pack with 4 orders, it would make thing a bit easier.  I will continue to get my Essentia as long as I am able to.  The water does have a lot of wonderful advantages.  I have fluid build up in my legs and sometimes my lungs because of my heart.  I had kidney failure, this water has helped me to be well hydrated and to keep my kidneys in working order.  The water goes directly where it is needed.",1
1401,I've tried many types of chocolate drinks since I don't drink milk. This one along with Trader Joe's chocolate soymilk are my favorites. Would give 5 stars except that it's pretty expensive.,1
1415,My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking.,1
1422,Love the Hawaiian Shaved ice flavors and so do my kids.  They have a rich not watered down taste that you can't beat.,1
1425,"Wow, these k cups are so yummy and perfect if you are on the go. They don't require cream and sweetener so just brew and go! The only thing I would like better is if they were sugar free using a sugar substitute and were lower fat or fat free. They do taste yummy though and for the price, you can go wrong!",1
1426,These cookies really satisfy my hunger for chocolate!  They are not too sweet yet have an intense chocolate flavor without the high calories of a candy bar.  They are great!!!,1
1444,"This is good stuff...nice to have for afternoon coffee break.  Sweet enough that you feel like you're having a treat, but it's NOT a doughnut!  Really very good.",1
1447,We really enjoyed this product -- containes no sugar (contains dates and such) and it's healthy while giving you the chocolate fix you need!,1
1452,"I like these.  Like the packaging too.  These are not chocolate dipped, but cocoa powdered.  And the flavor is cocoa, not chocolate.  Very sweet.  Probably good because a few go along way.  Very flavorful.",1
1453,"This is a great BBQ sauce that even our kids really like.  A little kick, but not spicy.  Great alternative for those looking for a low carb product without chemical sweeteners.",1
1454,"these are very flavorful fruit snacks.  My kids and i prefer them to others that have many more unhealthy ingredients.  they are pricey, but anything that says organic tends to be.",1
1455,"Normally I just don't like powdered drink mixes but these are really good! The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.  I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.  It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation.",1
1457,This is the only drink that has effectively replaced the urge to drink diet soda for me.Low in calories and super refreshing at lunch.Its like I am on a tropical beach looking at the ocean (at work).Now that's nice.,1
1467,"Finally I found a whole bag of ONLY GRAPE Jolly Ranchers!  They are delicious and have been rather popular in my candy jar in my office (lots of thieving coworkers). $36 for 160 or these and 160 Cherry was a bit steep, but I think I'm ahead in the end for not throwing away all the undesired flavors in the multi-flavor bags.",1
1469,Found these at Meijer's. Couldn't wait to try them. I think these are better than the regular chocolate ones. A much better chocolate flavor. Love them! Will be buying these instead of the other ones.,1
1473,"Quitting sugar is HARD. Nana's cookies make it MUCH easier. I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a ""high"" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny.",1
1485,"So many ""healthy"" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.",1
1488,This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet...,1
1491,This is a tasty flavor but not one I could drink everyday.  The honey flavor makes it a little sweet for my palette but for a dessert coffee it works wonderfully.  I won't but this for everyday repeated use but it is a good special treat flavor.,1
1495,"I use this every morning for the protein. Low calorie, lots of protein and I love the coffee flavor. Not a fan of the hot, but I throw it in my Magic Bullet with ice and water. Frozen and delicious.",1
1496,Gives popcorn a pleasing color and lets the corn pop fully. I have been very satisfied. I will purchase more of this.,1
1500,Never just made the orange by its self.  Miked it 50 50 with the cream soda made by the same company.  People were begging me for the recipy.  I never follow the instructions.  i have tasted this brand of soda prepared very poorly.  not by me tho.  Tip:  1 pound of sugar per gallon.  no more.  no less.  that is the master rule.,1
1509,"I have started eating almonds as a healthy alternative to fatty or high-carb snacks, but wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth on occasion. These Cocoa Roast almonds fit the bill nicely. They just have a dusting of cocoa, so there's no more fat or unhealthy stuff than you would find in regular almonds, but you still get a nice chocolate taste. They are just a little bit sweeter than I really want (I like dark chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet) but still a great once-in-awhile snack!",1
1510,"I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.",1
1514,Very tasty product...and low fat and natural. I have tried most of their flavors and like them all. Will buy again.,1
1519,"These are absolutely delicious and healthier than other cookies since made with wheat flour, rice syrup and cane juice rather than white flour and sugar.  My kids love them and enjoy them as a snack with a glass of milk.",1
1526,"This is the only store bought cookie I will eat. When it's Kashi, I know its healthy. Love the wholesome goodness of oats with the chocolate chips. This is a staple in my house. Treat yourself.",1
1531,The product is as advertised.  Very good chocolate.  It is a good alternative for those who do not drink coffee.,1
1538,"This product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important!  I prefer to drink my Grey Goose straight; however, on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice.  This product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice.  It's not worth it!!  The after taste is worse!!",1
1541,"Eat. Think. Smile. Granola clusters Cinnamon almond is 12 ounces of good eating.  Healthy, yet delicious granola clusters with almonds and cinnamon get the extra treatment of cocoa powder!  This delicious coating adds antioxidants and taste.  Whole grains give these treats thumbs up for me.  But all these healthy elements do add up to 160 calories per 1/3 cup serving.  Perfect for snacking right out of the bag, or I would eat them with milk or on top of yogurt.  Although these are definitely vegetarian, I do not know if they are vegan; as the ingredient list includes sugar and honey.  The product's website did not disclose that it is in fact vegan, so I would assume not.  I highly recommend this tasty, healthy snack!",1
1554,"Sweet and tasty, my whole family love it. My secondary favorite chocolate brand (Lindt is always on the top of my list), cheaper than Lindt.",1
1555,"I had high hopes for the convenience of this product.  My daughter LOVES hot chocolate. This really was a total disappointment.  I threw these kcups out.  If you use the smallest setting on your Keurig, you get 3 oz of watery hot chocolate.  Larger settings are not drinkable.  Save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa - and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides.",1
1559,"If you like sugar and tropical fruit, these snacks are for you.  They are small chunks with lots of flavor and they taste great.  My kids love them and I have purchased them many times.  Also good on cereal.  Sugar gets a bad rap, I recomend it for good health!",1
1579,"These are delicious and though they have a lot of sugar they also have a lot of vitamin C.  If you have trouble getting the kids to eat oranges, strawberries or anything with vitamin C - these can help.  These sell for a good price too, especially with the food discount going on!",1
1584,"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better.",1
1591,"First, my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome. I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :  - Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.  - Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.  - Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.  - Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.  - Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.  Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.  The can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go.",1
1592,"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.  I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.  So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.  So I'm stuck with 11 packs.  See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them.",1
1599,"This is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness.  I understand others' comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality.  Kind of tastes like 70% cherry juice mixed with 30% light prune juice.  I attribute this to the pasteurization process plus it's not filtered unlike a lot of prepared juices.  Still, I like it.",1
1603,"I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.",1
1604,"OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the ""club"" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience.",1
1611,"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free.",1

1620,"The product may be every bit as healthy as they claim, but even if that's true, I could barley get down one can of this stuff.  It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesn't taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isn't very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away.",1
1625,Great tasting.  Kids love them and I don't have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients.  A little pricey if you don't care if they are organic.,1
1626,I found this stuff at a big box retailer not too long ago and gave it a try. I was happy to find it here at a better price than the individual serving at the store.  It is a great drink to grab as I'm running to catch my carpool in the morning. It tides me over until I eat breakfast at work. I love chocolate coconut water and this is great because of the caffeine kick of the coffee.,1
1627,"I got this product because I was on the HCG diet and wanted a special treat for Valentine's Day. I was really hoping it would be good, but it wasn't. This chocolate can be used in cooking I suppose, if you add some additional sweetener to it. It did not relieve my craving for chocolate. It is very bitter tasting. When I tasted a tiny bite, it was just a little bitter. The bar is divided up into blocks. When I put a block in my mouth, it was awful and I ended up spitting it out. It made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it. Also, you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you don't like it. They should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity.",1

Another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten-free. Ordering from Amazon is fast, and they always seem to have the food products that I need.",1
1640,"This product does taste like sugar. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. It really is very expensive, so I keep trying other sugar substitutes to see if I could find a cheaper alternative. So far I haven't found anything that is close to this. There's no after taste, but start off using only a little because you might get stomach upset(diarrhea) then increase little by little so your system has time to get use to it.",1
1660,"Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the ""cauldron"" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild. It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.",1
1663,"I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies, calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy.",1
1675,"These cookies not only taste great, but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox.  When you have a child on a gluten-free diet, saving time on food prep is always appreciated.  They are definitely a favorite in my house.  We love them.  They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free.",1
1680,Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.,1

I can taste the pomegranate. The son that liked it gave it double thumbs up. I think it's light enough for an every day drink before working out. It has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you. Not so sure about that, but I am sure it tastes good.",1

I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.",1

Blue raspberry was by far the best with grape being the second best!  I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY ONE!!! IT IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!,1
1718,I have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice.  This product has been impossible to find where I live.  I have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces.  After finding it on Amazon I ordered it immediately but I was very dissatisfied with the taste of Gustaf's licorice.  It didnt taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft.  It didn't please me any more than the Twizzlers do.  It's just not a real licorice flavor.  I would never order Gustaf's licorice again.,1
1719,"I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or  Orange Crush Case 4-6pk  because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like  Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans  or  San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles .  Dare I say it? Yes. The flavor and size make it a perfect mixer. After my intial sip, I immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka.",1

1727,"I tried this product on a whim, hoping that it would be good. To my surprise, it was very good. I was pleased that the ingredients did not include trans fat or high fructose corn syrup. For a convenience item, I give it high marks. It tastes great and is extremely easy to prepare.",1

Perhaps I'll update after I take them hiking and see how they hold up.",1

I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice.",1

Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.  It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.  In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.  If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.",1
1755,"Moist, delicious with a delectable rum flavor.  It was a bit on the very sweet side, but overall a memorable dessert experience.",1
1757,"I generally like vitalicious products. The corn muffin, well, for 100 calories it's not bad. But if you are expecting anything like the sugar/fat laden junk that your local bakery sells, look elsewhere. this is like a healthy makeover that doesn't quite cut it, but they're not bad. For the same amount of calories, the chocolate one is more of an indulgence, but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat, especially baked fresh. My kids are happy to get any extra snacks, so they approve...i send with them to school for a midmorning snack. im glad they get fuel and vitamins.",1
1768,We enjoyed our package of pomegranate licorice.  I prefer to buy organic and this fits the bill.  It's not too sweet but yet still is candy.  The entire family enjoyed it and it was a nice special treat.  If you are looking for a nice treat that is not too sweet and sugary this works.  I would prefer that they didn't use corn syrup but it is candy.,1
1773,I love this cereal. I've never been a fan of Cocoa Crispies but I am a fan of Erewhon rice cereals so I decided to give this a shot. It's so tasty and addictive--without being disgusting sugary like the regular brands--that I find myself eating it for breakfast and sometimes dessert.,1
1781,"I expected to like this drink because I like various fruit juices and I like carbonated beverages, as well.  Unfortunately, I just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink. It was thick, had very little bubbly carbonation and, for me anyway, there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time.  I finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth.",1
1785,"Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can",1
1787,"Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini  tastes great  It's like drinking a  Jones Soda Green Apple  but without all the carbonation or calories.  my only issue is that they use Aspartame. with all the dangers that come with it, it'd be nice if they use stevia instead.  Other than that, if you're looking for a great apple tasting diet beverage, this is pretty good.",1
1791,"Product is as advertised!! My grandkids love them and I do too.  Great for on the go! B Brothers-ALL-Natural Fuji Apple Crisps, 0.35-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)",1
1794,"These are delicious!! A nice way to get a serving of fruit along with a chocolate fix, but dark chocolate so you get antioxidants, too.  Also, in the small package so you don't over-eat :)",1
1795,"I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc. My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her. I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less. But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!",1
1809,"Cranberry Grape XS has a wonderful taste and helps give me energy for my daily workouts with out the ""crash"" effect later in the day. XS, unlike other energy drinks, balances out the day.",1
1810,"Compare to other nutritional bars out there you'll find these are one of the few that are low in calories (150) and pack a good amount of protein (11 grams), and they taste great!  I love these bars.",1
1820,"I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!",1
1821,"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.  While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",1
1837,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FLAVORS. THESE LOLLIPOPS HAVE NO COMPETITION. GREAT FLAVORS TO CHOOSE FROM AND BEST FLAVOR IN A LOLLIPOP YET.,1
1838,THESE FRUIT THINS ARE VERY TASTY.  THEY ARE LOADED WITH FIGS WHICH ARE LOADED WITH VITAMIN B 6.  THEY ARE ALSO NOT NAUSIATINGLY OVER SWEETENED WHICH IS GREAT FOR US DIABETICS.  I REALLY LIKED THESE COOKIES AND PLAN TO BUY THEM AGAIN.,1
1843,"These are soft chocolate chip cookies that also have a fudge filling.  Very good, although I slightly prefer the Megafudge version, as these are just a tiny bit sweeter than I prefer.",1
1846,"I bought this chocolate for my parents as a gift. They loved it, it has a little sour taste and good quality of chocolate.",1
1847,"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass.",1
1849,"These cookies were unexpectedly tasty and crispy given the fact that there was no hydrogenated fat in them. I always look at the list of ingredients for the word, ""hydrogenated"" even when the label says ""no trans fat.""  They're not too sweet, with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar. I agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them, and with only 140 calories for three cookies (about 47 calories per cookie), one could get into trouble by overindulging. My husband and I really liked these, however.  These would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream. Enjoy!",1
1858,Calorie count is good. The orange smoothie is the best.  These bars used to be sold by costco. They are much moister than other bars.,1
1862,"I love how these mints taste.  Compared to the classic Peppermint flavor ( which I used before ) they are a bit less strong and ""spicy"".  They taste very sweet and still give off a great minty scent.  And they don't get the horrible sour aftertaste that classic Altoids do.  I love these mints.",1
1864,I did not like the taste of this hot chocolate and my kids didn't either.  I will not buy again.,1
1866,"I fell in love with these delightful candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany.  A perfect combination of hazelnut chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer.  They are adorably cute as they resemble little hippos.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this is a wonderful flavor combination and a tasty little treat.",1
1873,"These are very good.  Not too sweet like most ""fig newton"" type bars and not gritty like some high fiber or high protein bars.  We eat them for afterschool snacks or breakfast on the run.",1
1884,"This is a close match to sugar, and is supposed to be better for you than other artificial sweeteners.  A little expensive.",1
1896,"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty.",1
1908,"the greatest, best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i'm a chocolate nut, and these pass the test.",1
1909,"This product has a very good taste, not like many of the other energy drinks.  It tastes like berries and is smooth, not tart, at least to me.  I had 2 four ounce glasses during the day.  I didn't notice a huge spike in energy, but I didn't need an afternoon nap either.  It didn't make me jittery etc. and I slept well at night.  I wish it came in a diet drink, no calories.  I would recommend this for the taste.",1
1915,"These have a lot less sugar than other brands, but still a lot of chocolate flavor.  I'd eat plain almonds every now and then but they left my mouth dry.  These are addictive, and I eat them every day.  They make a great, healthy snack.",1
1917,These cereal bars are great.  The ones with strawberry and blueberry are the best.  They are chewy but still soft.,1
1921,"I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years (including the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds ), and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste. I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids. Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.  As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option. There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3.5g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol. There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g/20% are from sugar. There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 130 calories.",1
1922,i forgot all about these fine treats...i think i will add them to my order...there are so many sugar free treats that dont seem sugar free and this is one of them...shaka sez check 'em out,1
1926,Awesomely tasty cereal. Cocoa Beach is my favorite all time and also by Kashi. Kid cereal for adults. SCHWEET,1
1941,"A nice little break from the traditional chocolate mint Andes candy.  The cherry jubilee is not too sweet, it's just right!  Package-wise, I always look at the weight of the candy and not the packaging. Can't go wrong with Andes. It's an office favorite with our software developers.  =)",1
1945,"First, the nutrition facts:  Serving size: 1/2 cup Servings per container: about 7  Calories: 220 Fat: 6g Sodium 5mg Carbohydrates: 37g (Dietary Fiber 4g, Sugars 13g, Other carbs 20g) Protein: 5g  This granola is really very tasty. The chocolate chunks add a nice flavor and texture, and the granola is very crunchy. It comes in a plastic zip-seal bag.  With so much chocolate and sugars, this is by no means a ""health food"", but it's a great snack that at least has some nutrients, unlike candy bars for instance. And it tastes just as good, if not better.  Disclosure: Although I was not paid for this review, I received one pouch of this product for free.",1
1947,"This was a tasty snack that I enjoyed. Might be a little to hard for those with teeth problems, but otherwise okay. Oats, walnuts, and cranberry with a little chocolate is a good combination.",1
1950,I love the taste of this milk chocolate. It has the perfect amount of sweetness for me and a very nice smell of the cacao.,1
1953,"I never met a piece of chocolate I did not like, but this has an aftertaste I do not like. I do like all the other IF creamers I ordered but this!",1
1956,I purchased one bottle for 6.99. I wish I would have spent it on something else. First the water looks disgustingly dirty and it has some weird taste to it. Do not drink warm it will taste worse.  I will stick with regular faucet water.,1
1962,"I 1st seen these on Shark Tank and what drew me to them was they were made for a diabetic by a diabetic. I decided to try a box and I can truly say they do taste good. They do fulfill that sweet satisfaction you look for. I'm not a big fan on granola bars but I think I can get use to these. They are also healthy, can't go wrong with that.",1
1968,This tastes like actual soda pop. you'd never know it was healthy for you! every can is lightly carbonated and gives you 100% vitamin c and contains 100 percent real fruit juice. what more can you ask for? I got the variety pack and all the flavors taste good. I only wish amazon kept it in stock for the subscribe and save.,1
1971,The hemp protein is not only a great buy but it has a pretty good taste especially when mixed with white grape juice(8 oz). Mixes easily with liquids. Love it and happy to be healthy. Great option for those with ulcerative colitis or lactose intolerence.,1
1979,I was following a diet where no sugar was allowed.  I tried this product and it has a good taste with out sugar.  I also used to put some other mint flavor herb tea mixed with this to get my own flavor.  Worth trying.,1
1985,I made rum soaked worms for a TGIF for my building and they were a big hit. Really good texture and taste just plain too,1
1988,"If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing.",1
1993,"I don't know why other people are complaining about the taste.  I mixed it with almond milk and really liked it.  Maybe the flavors go well together.  In any case, it tastes a lot like every other protein powder I've tried, except without the disgusting synthetic sweetness.",1
1996,This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.,1
2003,"Get the variety pack first and try each one. I like all three, but the peppermint chocolate and dark chocolate I like the best.",1

2006,I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.,1
2008,"I have been trying all kinds of ""diet"" drinks because I am getting tired of just water all the time. So many diet drinks have a strong after taste, or no flavor at all. I have always liked Crystal Light drinks, but have been hoping for some new flavors. These new Moctails flavors are great! They have a very different flavor from their other mixes. The Mojito flavor is refreshing and has a wonderful taste. I definitely recommend you try all the Moctails flavors - you won't be dissapointed.",1
2016,"Mi-Del Old-Fashion ""Swedish Style"" Lemon Snaps are a crispy, chewy, lemony delight! If you are always in search of healthy snacks that aren't short on flavor, these are the cookies for you.  These Lemon Snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour, canola oil and natural lemon flavor -- there's no artificial ""lolly-pop"" lemon taste here. You can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix, yourself.  Five cookies have 140 calories, so it's not too much for a little something to get you through your day, or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt.  Highly recommended. Yum!",1
2019,"Once again, Paragon has disappointed with this flavor. The Hawaiian Tropic, simply did not carry much flavor, and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. I do not recommend this syrup concentrate.",1
2026,I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!,1
2030,"These are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever - I usually bake my own cookies but to be honest I'm not sure I can do better than these!  They are soft, melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor.",1
2031,"This extract is strange... I put a little into my recipe and it sort of had an almost peanut buttery hint of flavor, but not quite, so i thought it needed a bit more. I put in the tiniest bit more and the flavor changed drastically and tasted not like peanut butter, but like alcohol. Not good at all.",1
2037,"This is a great healthy product at a good price.  Not the first time I buy it, and not the last.",1
2039,I purchased these to add drops of lemon juice to my water.  They're great!  I gave it 4 stars because I don't really have anything else to compare it to.,1
2057,"I just squeezed some into some water and drank. The liquid mixed with the water with little agitation. You can use as much or as little as you like. I did a 2 second shot. My drink was light, refreshing and not overly sweet.  It didn't taste like Snapple, for example, but I enjoyed it. I plan on getting more.",1
2067,"I get bored with plain water - and I drink a lot every day.  I tried the Cherry Berry Flavrz because I wanted a drink mix that contained NO corn syrups or artificial sweetners.  This product fit the bill AND delivered a great tasting drink.  Low cal, too!  Try it!  It really is good.",1
2075,"cardboard box is a bit shoddy, but the candies are perfect.  taste great, just as I remember them.  4 flavors is kinda lacking, but so what.",1
2077,"I was disappointed by my first taste of Kopali Organics Chocolate Covered Dried Banana. The chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me. I was expecting more crunch, a drier banana. The banana did not taste of banana to me either. I will not purchase again.",1
2080,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.",1
2084,"I love this stuff.  It's like the Sencha shot, but with a bit softer flavor profile.  Still fills in like an energy drink but without the weirdly contrived and overly sweet flavors of those drinks.  This stuff is also actually good for you.",1
2095,Dark Chocolate cookies taste great!  I have just tried the peanut butter and those are good too.,1
2097,Check around. There is a very large markup on this product.  I like the idea of giving out animal cookies instead of so much surgery candy. Kids get too many sweets these days with corn syrup in everything.,1
2103,tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.  it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape,1
2106,"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.  I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.  I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good.",1
2113,First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate.  This is my first time however trying this particular mixture.  I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.,1
2119,The kids in our son's party were super excited that they had flavors to choose from before I made their cotton candy..and what colorful flavors too! Cherry & Grape were the favorites. The cherry and Blue raspberry were the most colorful.,1
2121,Tasty moist not too sweet just perfect. It its true rumcake. The taste of rum is minimul however it is there just enough.,1
2123,"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda.",1
2128,This are the cheapest bags I've found! They don't have any weird scent and are big enough for big-dog waste.,1
2130,"Very delicious.  Taste was 5 stars; ingredients why I dropped one star (added sugar!) but still, I would recommend this product.",1
2131,These chocolate chips taste great and have a creamy texture. Even when meltling the consistancy is creamy and yummy.  I use them for baking gluten free cookies and breads.,1
2135,This bar is good. It tastes like eating a banana mixed in with some nuts. I like that it doesn't have any sugar added and it just uses the natural sugars from the banana to flavor the bar.,1
2140,The dried fruit are very tasty. The individual pkgs are handy and convenient. Great for people on the go. I recommend this product.,1
2144,"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!  I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.",1
2150,"This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again.",1
2158,"I have used this chocolate drink previously and I love the cocoa flavor that it has and it does suppress my appetite while providing a little boost of energy. It does give you a huge jolt, which is great because by the end of the day I am able to get a good night's sleep. If hot chocolate is a thumbs up to you then you will love this drink plus its benefits.",1
2165,"Love this product. Do not like ""diet"" drinks but this one is very good without the after taste that aspartame leaves. I add more water then the directions give and like it better this way.",1
2173,Got this for my sister and had a bite. As some one who normally eats gummies i gotta say  i thought it tasted better then the normal sized bears. Also i dont recommend eating it in one sitting ;),1
2175,"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.  The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids.",1
2180,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and it was disappointing.  The quality of the chocolate is very poor, closer to Hershey kisses than Dove or Godiva.  The bacon flavor was off, kind of bitter and more like bacon bits than actual bacon.  Overall, i wish i hadn't wasted $30 on 4 bars of sub-par chocolate. I know you want to try this for yourself because you think that everyone is being too picky, that's what i thought too, but don't!  Save your money and make your own chocolate bacon bar at home.",1
2183,"These diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant, non-sticky crunch. With 6 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber to 6 grams of sugar and only 120 calories, they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so-called diet products.  I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.  Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening. These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too.",1
2196,"I'm always looking for healthy snack alternatives. But healthy snacks are not always very tasty. This one was. It has a good crunch factor and the chocolate and berry flavors stood out without being overpowering.  My two teen aged sons fought over the bag. One enjoyed is as a cereal, the other just as a snack.  I, myself enjoyed it sprinkled over some fat-free frozen yogurt. The serving size (1/4 cup) is a little small. It would be easy to eat the whole bag without even realizing it. But it's perfect as a topping for yogurt or ice cream. My boys have asked me to add this to my regular shopping list.",1
2197,This true bar is very tasty and feeling and a great pick me up between meals.  The flavors are great and and it doesn't leave you dry in the mouth like some bars do.,1
2208,These noodles are delicious and surprisingly my favorite of all the flavors so far. I orderd some for my daughter also and son.,1
2212,"The Amita Peach Nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar. So, if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories, you might want to give this drink a try. Also, it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis.",1
2234,Great way to keep fruit in your diet. If you follow Weight Watcher this is a good snack for you. Three point and you get more fruit in your diet.,1
2236,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.,1
2242,"This is very good.  A nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi, and very sweet even with no added sugar. The fruit flavors are strong, but very natural, without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with.  The carbonation is nice - it's not too bubbly, but just pleasantly effervescent.  This is a product I would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda, but I had to take away one star since I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is.",1
2243,"This is a very tasty and healthy cracker, full of dietary fiber.  I highly recommend it for taste, low calories, and texture.",1
2248,"I usually stick to 100 calorie pack snacks, but at only 130 calories, I thought I'd give these a try. They are very tasty-not too sweet, but enough to satisfy my ever-present sweet tooth. The size of the package is just right for a mid-day snack.",1
2254,"I didn't want caffeine, don't want the high calories & went through MANY types of energy chews / gels / drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself.  I LOVE the honey stingers!  No caffeine, calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take, and most importantly, it lasted me through my marathon trainings :)  Fruit smoothy is delicious.  Haven't tried the other flavors.",1
2255,"Received this on time, in fact, early. I was looking for an energy booster during the day at work. These chocolates were great tasting and did give me the boost I was looking for. I'll purchase them again.",1
2262,"I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses, even that labeled blackstrap, that I have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor. This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands.",1
2264,"This is a great meal replacement. I even throw in to the blender 1/2 fluids that are apple juice and water, 1/2 banana and a strawberry. Yummy and filling. I do not run out of steam on the tennis courts anymore.",1
2265,First of all I was very surprised to get this so fast. I just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before 11 am. ( which never happens) anyway I opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good. Now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks I have had. I will be reordering this and I will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one.,1
2267,"These are absolutely great freeze pops, especially if you like anything that's a little sour.  These are very unique and certainly worth trying.",1
2271,"The Oatmeal Raisin bars by Quaker are a tasty treat, but unlike some bars, they aren't too sweet or too bland. They have enough sweentess to make them flavorful, but don't go to extremes. They are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack. In stores, it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of 10. I've tried a few of the others kinds made by Quaker Oats, but these are my favorites.",1
2272,"The picture and description was Pure Butter Mini Shortbread Round, then I decided to order it because I love them so bad. But when i got the package, it came out at Mini CHOCOLATE CHIP shortbread which I don't like.",1
2273,Thought I would just try this and I am glad I did. Great taste and the delivery was very fast. We BBQ all the time and I now have a new favorite! Well worth a try!,1
2278,"My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.  I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.  I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.  My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!  If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.",1
2282,"I've become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being ""100% juice"" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.  I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure.  The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)   Also, you'll want to note that The Switch sodas aren't exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars.",1
2289,"A very tasty, organic 7g of protein and 5g of fiber, with only 9g of sugar and 200 calorie snack which is good for those on the go or those who who just want something healthy. This combination (Peanut Raisin Crunch) is very tasty.",1
2291,"Newtons Fruit Thins are quite delicious.  As soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies, you can taste the real blueberries, right down to a few seeds, but I did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor. They are just the right thickness to be crispy, not hard.  The package contains a plastic tray with 2 rows of cookies, 15 cookies in each row. Very enjoyable!",1
2293,"I'm not sure about the calorie count, but I do enjoy this product.",1
2294,"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug.",1
2302,This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.,1
2304,The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!,1
2316,"great jam...spicey,crisp just a little sweet. maybe not the best for breakfast but perfect for afternoon tea.",1
2317,"This is literally the best cereal in my entire life that I have ever eaten. It's a perfect supplement to a whole foods vegan diet. at 16g of protein per cup, packed with fiber, minerals, and vitamins, you cannot go wrong with this cereal. This texture and taste are not for everyone, but for those who like hearty, multi grain, sugar free types of food, this is the cereal for you!",1
2320,"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.  Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice.",1
2328,"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!",1
2339,"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee.",1
2351,Taste great. I use this to make vanilla latte and vanilla coke. YUM!!! and it doens't contain any corn syrup!!!,1
2354,"These are wonderful! They have a great, light sweetness and real chocolate flavor. Their consistency is that of hard candy (not like a melty chocolate), just what I wanted. I keep them in my bag and use them to stave off afternoon munchies. Great for diabetics and hypoglycemics.",1
2361,"The hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it.  I will not be buying this product again, and will probably not consider any more green mountain products.",1
2368,I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.  The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.,1
2370,"My fiance and I both really love this one. I am a salt fiend (bought the low sodium version because it's cheaper) and I didn't even feel a need to add any. I really loved it. Healthy, easy and tasty. You need to make sure you make it correctly though. I boil water in a kettle, then add the seasoning and a little water - stir it really thoroughly, then I add the rest of the water to the line and cover it with the spoon. Wait 5 min or so and then stir again before eating. Perfect! :)",1
2375,My kids loved this tasty treat. The apple pieces were a nice size and tasted like a fresh apple. Will be buying more of these in the future!,1
2385,"This is one of the best protein bars I've tasted yet.  That it's vegan and made with more natural ingredients than most bars is a huge plus, but the main selling point is that this bar is something you actually want to eat.",1
2395,"This agave seriously has the best flavor, I have used several different brands of agave and they all have a weird aftertaste but not Xagave. It makes it so much easier to incorporate it into my recipes.",1
2408,"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.  From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!",1
2410,I am a HUGE Vita Coco fan. I drink it almost ever day. This flavor terrible. I cant believe that Vita Coco sells it. Stay away,1
2413,I do not think I am going to drink this anymore. Everytime I drink it I feel like I am on fear factor. With an after workout powder like this I do not look forward to drinking it after a workout,1
2414,I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).,1
2418,"Growing up with this tasty treat, I was really excited when I found it on Amazon. Great little calorie overload with your afternoon tea or late night milk/cookie snack. I have no clue how many calores one of  wafers will ""provide"" and I don't care. I love it, I treat myself to it  from time to time without guilt. Life is to short to bother with calories. Wafers are packed with flavor, crispy and tasty. Rum is fake, just for flavor, no alcohol in it. Enjoy it and then work out next day a bit harder. I do!",1
2419,"Simply put, this tea is delicious.  The mango taste is smooth and not overwhelming and all the ingredients are blended well so nothing is overpowering.  I also like the fact that Numi did not pump tons of sugar into the tea to make it overly sweet, thereby cutting down on calories, carbs, and sugar.  As the label indicates, this is 'barely sweetened' but it tastes just right.  There are also little 'gems' of wisdom underneath the bottle caps.  I can't wait to try every flavor in this line of Puerh teas in the glass bottle.  I did not order the tea through Amazon, rather I got it directly through the Numi tea website, but wanted to give a review here for others.",1
2421,These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!,1
2428,"I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  My husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too.",1
2431,The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.,1
2432,I used these as a healthier option than chocolate for some cake pops. The yogurt is strong and tasty. I would buy again.,1
2440,"These are moist, soft and chewy with a really nice texture.  The cinnamon flavor is really good -- nice and strong (I love cinnamon!) and really natural tasting, not artificial like a lot of cinnamon flavors.  They are a little on the small side (like 5 or 6 bites) but also pretty low cal (150 cals) so they make a nice snack or light breakfast.  I will definitely be buying these again!",1
2449,"These sugar-free Russell Stover Cinnamon Bun Snack Bars didn't last long here!  If I had not known they were sugar-free, I'd never have guessed it.  The bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy, which I like.  They do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack.  The bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar-free snack bar. Each bar has only 100 calories.  Russell Stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free, and I intend to sample a lot more of them.  Highly recommend!",1
2454,The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.  As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.  To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK.,1
2456,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me.",1
2457,"These grapes are very tasty, the right mixture of sweet and tart.  Very light and so good I ate the whole bag in 1 day,  I will purchase it again.",1
2469,The kids love these.  They are very tasty and healthier than most toaster pastries.,1
2471,We love K-cups and the ease of using them. The donut house collection (chocolate glazed donut) is great tasting! I would highly recommend these K-cups,1
2483,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).  It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.  I also have envirokids to try next.",1
2494,These are one of my favorite rice cake flavors.  They are just a little sweet and a great healthy snack between meals.  Will order again.,1
2505,"The hot chocolate has a great taste. I purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed. The kids had no idea it was sugar free. Even the adults we gave it to had no clue. Like other reviewers said - it doesn't mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up. If you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water, stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted. On a positive note, each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!",1
2508,These are tasty but really sweet.  I didn't notice they made my blood sugar stable any longer than any other bar.  I might buy them again if the price was right.,1
2513,THESE LOLLIPOPS HAVE THE BEST FLAVOR EVER. I'VE TRIED MANY BUT THESE ARE DEFINITELY THE VERY BEST. THEY COME IN MANY FLAVORS. SOMETHING FOR EVERONE.,1
2517,"I purchased this on a whim based on a co-worker's comment about how much they like this brand.  It's not the best value at $1.25 each on subscribe & save but I was interested enough to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  All three flavors were great and each time I picked one up I was saying, ""This is definitely my favorite flavor"" but then I'd say the same on the next one and let's just call it a vicious circle!  I did want to point out, and why I deducted 1 star, the picture of the product listed shows ""Pomegranate Berry, Orange Mango and Black Raspberry"".  However, the package that was received had Lemon Lime in place of Pomegranate Berry.  While it was a great flavor, I was looking forward to trying the Pomegranate Berry.  I'm hoping maybe my next shipment is what is shown on the picture.",1
2518,Item as described.  Texture of gummy softer than a normal gummy bear (probably due to size).  Very good though.,1
2534,"This juice tastes great, and even my picky two year old loves it. It is very sweet so its perfect for those moms like myself who like to limit sugar (even natural kind) intake and delute down juices with water.",1
2538,"Unlike most snacks, this one is full of nutritious ingredients.  You won't feel guilty enjoying it!",1
2541,"If you want to eat healthy this is it.  It tastes pretty good, but I add a little bit of honey to it and let it soak in milk for about 1/2 hour before eating it for breakfast.",1
2544,I bought this for Halloween treats. Ordered it on the 8th and it came on the 10th! Great service. I like this candy bar better than the Butterfinger bar which seems to fall apart when taking the bar out of the wrapper.The chocolate seems to be a better grade in the Clark bar.,1
2556,"I love these bears because their sweetness is a bit more subtle than the regular gummy bears--I don't like things to be too sweet. That doesn't mean these guys are lacking in flavour, though...just that they taste more like fruit and less like sugar! They're chewier as well, which is something else I love--keeps me from eating too many at a time!",1
2566,"This is a nice little coffee drink - not too sweet, only 100 calories and as good as Starbucks Lo Fat drinks.  Would have preferred a glass container but the little cans fit really well in my handbag.",1
2573,"I sampled a can of Switch Orange Tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage. As advertised, it is a ""...balance between juice and carbonated"" with a light carbonation so it doesn't taste like Orange Crush or Fanta but not like orange Gatorade either. The 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, with a 12% DV carb/sugar content but 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vit A. It's marketed as ""100% juice"" coming mostly from filtered concentrates. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, if you're concerned with all that. Most important is that it tastes good and I would try it again.",1
2595,GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR SODA AND TASTE GREAT!  DISSOLVES COMPLETELY WITH NO ADDED RESIDUE!  I WILL TRY OTHER FLAVORS FROM THIS MANUFACTURES.,1
2596,"Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  It's got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.)",1
2615,"I fell in love with this product.  I find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda.  This product has saved me.  I use it in everything I would use regular sugar for.  My favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet.  Talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines, this is the one for me.  Now I want to find a ""brown sugar"" variation of this.  Raley's supermarket used to carry Smart Sugar and then quit stocking it.  I bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until I could find another source.  Thanks to Amazon, I can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely.  I'll be placing my order for 5 bags very soon.  Thanks to everyone involved in the production of Smart Sugar!",1
2623,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.,1
2627,We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.,1
2632,"Good healthy snack.  Good plain, and also I tried mixing with plain yogurt and honey which is a great snack and adds a bit of protein to the meal.",1
2648,"I'm jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll-up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. That's all you need to know.  DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers.",1
2675,"Huge fan of this crystal light flavor.  I usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated, so I mix one packet with 24 oz of water and it comes out just right--not too sweet.  The color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes--it is a pale green color, so nothing like the bright red, blue, purple, orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you.",1
2684,"Great size to try out Xylitol before making a larger commitment.  I like that it is Birch and not Corn, and made in USA.  You should be aware that Xylitol has a spearmint type sweetness to it. It may alter the taste of some foods because of this trait. I use it in my coffee as a substitute for regular sugar and I am completely satisfied.  You need to add slightly more to get the same level of sweetness, but its close.",1
2686,"This tastes great. At first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste. I mixed the Amazing Green Superfood (the chocolate version) with it which made the Amazing Green taste much better. I need to buy more of this Hemp Shake since i'm out. It really makes the Amazing Green taste much better. I mix it with milk using a little wisk, which works well. I recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir, boost their immune system, and it is a great snack.  Try both the products together, it's a great combination. I have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy. I even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick! As a teacher getting sick is common for me, but i have noticed that i've been healthier since using these products. Give it a try!",1
2695,"If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas.",1
2703,"These are exactly what they say they are- cocoa roasted almonds.  People expecting an overly sweet, chocolate covered almond are going to be disappointed.  They do contain artificial sweeteners which seem to be one of the biggest complaints, but I'd also counter that with the argument that normal chocolate covered almonds have it too.  Overall, they're sweet, but not overtly so.  A good snack for people looking for a slightly less sugar loaded version of a sweet almond.",1
2707,"Very deep and tasty Caffe drink. It's got just a hint of sweetness and a hint of chocolate taste. Not too much fat and less sugar than most drinks of this type. Even my husband who doesn't like coffee likes it. It reminds me of a Starbucks double shot, but less sweet and it has less cream. I'd definitely buy these and try them again.",1
2710,My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.,1
2711,"I am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar. I've always enjoyed Haribo gummies, so I tried their sugar free version and WOW. You can't tell the difference. They are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same. As a matter of fact, so good, me kids ate almost all them. Not many candies I enjoy that are sugar free, but these are the ticket.",1
2720,"My Chocolate Lab, Lizzy is very active even at 9 years old. SHe does eat yogurt but will not eat any vegetables so this is a way for her to get some fruit. SHe really looks forward to these treats. They smell great. I keep them in a lagre glass container on the Kitchen counter and one time had a house guest mistake them for a cookie.",1
2722,bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon  They ARE addictingly good..the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting.  I was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely,1
2726,"This jerky is the soft, chewy style.  Though it is listed as Sweet'N'Spicy, it's quite a bit more sweet than spicy.  I doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky.  It's tasty, it doesn't have any nitrites, MSG, high fructose corn syrup or anything else that's terrible for you.  It's also affordable.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it's not an outstanding and amazing, one-of-a-kind flavor worthy of five stars.",1
2729,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!,1
2737,"I love this sugar.  I've been using it, packaged in envelopes, for a year or two for everything.  Gives a great homemade taste to cookies.  And packaged in envelopes - see  Sugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  - it's wonderful stuff.  But not in this packaging.  If you don't use the whole 12 pounds right away, the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock.  Have to microwave them, pound them with a hammer, and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear - e.g.,  JBK Bear Terra Cotta Brown Sugar Saver  - to make it possible to use it.  Definitely not worth it.  Buy it packaged in bags or not at all.",1
2744,The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.,1
2747,"I had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful. This one is pretty good.  I admit, it's not the best-tasting sweetener, but I suppose it's the healthiest alternative (so far as we know anyways), thus it's the one I use. I use to use Equal many years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out it was a neurotoxin. Then I started using Splenda, which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes. But now you hear about it not being that great either (healthwise), being chlorinated and all, so I stopped using it. Then I tried Truvia. Like I said, it's not the best - it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea, and using it for whipped cream did not work at all, I ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible. I primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries, as I still need a touch of sweetness, so one packet is great, tastes good. I also use it for my other low carb dessert - 2-3 oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of Truvia, also good.",1
2756,"I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didn't have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If these were the only GF cookies available, I still wouldn't buy them again.",1
2763,DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal. The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE.,1
2766,We love these little figs.  They are a great snack and a pop in your mouth size. Will definately buy them again.,1

2775,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks.",1
2778,I'm happy to have found a drink flavor mix that uses the healthier option of Stevia.  Tastes pretty good.  I use it with a fiber mix so it's just fine.  Fiber drinks like metamucil typically have the less healthy sweeteners so I just buy Konsyl and mix it with the Stevita.,1
2781,"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:  INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)  Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.  So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?  Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.  I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.  In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.  Pam T~ mom/blogger/brownie baker",1
2783,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again.",1
2785,"The packaging makes this great on the go. The applesauce is tasty - I think it's green apples, so it has a little green apple taste but not sour. Kids like it and like the squeezy action involved. The amount is great for a quick snack. It would be easy to use while walking/runny/biking as an alternative to the energy shot/gel things that some people like to use.",1
2786,"To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.  There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?  This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.  ""Switch"" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.  If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep.",1
2792,"This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.  It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:  Vitamin C - 120% Vitamin B6 - 40% Vitamin B5 - 40% Vitamin B3 - 40% Vitamin B12 - 40% Zinc - 10% Chromium - 10%  The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it.",1
2805,"I've been wary of trying this, since most people complained about the chocolate being quite tart. Thank goodness I gave into my own curiosity. My boyfriend and I LOVE this treat. It was originally for him, but once I had a bite, I pretty much took it from him and nibbled like a hungry mouse. The sweet blend of chocolate and strawberry flavor is amazing. I wish I had purchased more of these bars!",1
2810,"We happened to be at Whole Foods and a lovely woman was offering free samples of Violas Hot Jalepeno Jelly. Omg It is fantastic! It's got a definite kick to it but it's not too terribly hot at all. PERFECTION. It's just sweet enough to balance out the hot. It's light and delicious. And best of all, it's not full of all the artificial preservatives and high fructose corn syrup and additives of which most jellies are contaminated.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!",1
2811,The wife had me buy it for her..it actually tastes good with nothing more than a little 2% on it..not real hard like some of the cereals that make your mouth hurt from chewing it up..,1
2812,This doesn't have a weird sugar free taste.  It's the best and I always use it.,1
2814,"I have never tried the similar candies before so maybe I have nothing to compare these with, but I really enjoyed them. It is not too sweet and just has a pleasant taste overall.  I think I will be buying these candies for myself in the future. I tried Newman's Own other products and I am happy that this one has not dissappointed me.",1
2823,I cannot have chocolate but can consume white chocolate. I was looking for something to add to my milk so I could have a change once in awhile. This product is very good tasting but doesn't mix to well in cold milk. I still use it though and enjoy the flavor!,1
2831,"Best dark chocolate ever, I wish it was stocked well at amazon",1
2841,"This is a fantastic chocolate bar, you can't even tell it is dairy free. This is NOT a milk chocolate flavor, it tastes more like a marriage of milk and dark chocolate. I am actually not usually a fan of dark chocolate but this is not overwhelmingly dark at all, it is perfect.",1
2843,"I've wanted to find a stevia-sweetened soda for a long time, but I don't like typical colas or lemon-lime soft drinks.  I had hoped this would taste a little more like that other, well-known Dr. drink, but to be honest it just doesn't.  I guess my slight disappointment with that difference led me to knock off a star in my rating.  All in all however, it's a good flavor.  Bit of a cherry with a hint of citrus.",1
2854,"I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.",1
2855,"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments. If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself.",1
2859,"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks   no caffeine   no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you) Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)   can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it   lots of calories  I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.  I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.",1
2861,"I was looking for a water mix-in without artificial sweetners. This uses Stevia, which I use at home. Just what I was looking for. It has fruit punch taste with tons of Vitamin C to boot.",1
2863,"I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally- and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally. #very disappointed",1
2866,"I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!",1
2870,"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!  I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.",1
2873,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. THESE SNACKS ARE CRISP AND GREAT TASTING. ALSO LOW IN CALORIES. I RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY. THEY ARE SHIPPED ALMOST INSTANTLY AND ARRIVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.,1
2876,Listen if you want a good taste and hot. This the stuff! It won't melt your eyes out .but it is too hot to take straight . One dab will do ya on a bite of pizza!,1
2880,"What can I say that you probably don't already know?  It's Monster, a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water.  The problem is that I can find this MUCH cheaper in regular stores.",1
2906,"A tasty snack, but a little too sweet.  Don't leave them in a warm car they get horribly sticky.  Not for someone with braces either.",1
2909,These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig,1
2910,My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?,1
2920,"These are great.  I'm not a huge fan of vegetables, but I'll snack on these.",1
2923,"This Hafi Lingonberry preserves not only arrived in a timely fashion, but also adds favorably to our morning and afternoon snack experiences.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  My husband adds it to the very healthy shake he makes for the two of us each morning.  I also occasionally like to get my healthy bit of snack in by dipping a few toasted pita chips in the early afternoon when I get most hungry.  Just one or two chips with a total of about one teaspoon of preserves will do it for me for a healthy snack that will not spoil my dinner.  Very happy with the product.",1
2924,"I buy these for the whole family.  Coconut Cream Pie is our favorite flavor.  (We also like the chocolate varieties and Key Lime Pie.)  My 5yo and 2yo sons think these are a real treat since they are so sweet.  I love the simple, natural ingredients too.  They are a little pricey, but healthier foods usually are.",1
2932,"This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.  They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.  For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a ""health drink""? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.  For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good.",1
2934,"I wanted to try Cherrytree Cola for no particular reason other than I'd heard Fentimans makes some pretty good drinks. So I ordered a few from Amazon, and they shipped in like three days. I absolutely love this soda. I don't drink much pop because the carbonation is overbearing for me, but this was different. It was much smoother than regular colas and had a great taste. The only downside is that it's expensive. I won't be purchasing more right away, but if I could I would!",1
2936,"I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.  The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead.",1
2940,"I'm not sure that these bars are really all that different from a candy bar -- they're pretty sweet and not exactly low-calorie. However, they are quite tasty.",1
2942,"This particular flavor is almost impossible to find,and in my opinion,it is one of the best.I was very happy to find it on Amazon(what can't you find on Amazon?).This flavor is tart and refreshing,just right for Arizona summers,where i happen to live.It is not even halfway through  June, and the temps are triple digits! Thank goodness for this wonderful drink,which also keeps me hydrated...just mix with water and you are good to go.",1
2947,"This product tastes just like any other cinnamon bun!  I was skeptic at first...but the taste is very good.  Everybody at home liked them. At 3g net carbs, it is a treat you can afford in your coffee break in your low carb lifestyle.",1
2949,These are really good tasting lentils. The first thing I notice was the lack of that shinny coating you see on store bought lentils. When you open the big you can tell right away there is something different about these. They cook easily and hold their shape and taste great.,1
2955,"I've had Amy and Brians coconut water - yum!, Vico's plain in the tetra pack - great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate - blah and yuck- don't get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles- green cover- can't remember the name, but pure coconut water -great too.  This, one with pineapple- no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.  I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!)",1
2957,I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?,1
2961,"Gimme better ingredients (KIND/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure I'd invest in a single bar again, let alone this size.",1
2988,"I put my Orange Switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold, and I had it with breakfast.  I love the taste of it - mostly orange, with a hint of carbonation.  It tastes sweet naturally and I'm sure it's good for you.  I would buy this product  :-)",1
2999,"The flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding(bluberry) and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick (unlike this companys fig bars) and pastry textured.Flavored with cane  syrup(not fruit juice).150 cal per bar,and low in fat and the carbs(29) not too bad considering the great taste.",1
3002,"i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.  i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box  one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.  i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)",1
3004,This syrup is really good. It has a lot of flavor without being overly sweet. One or two pumps is enough to give my espressos a rich butterscotch flavor. I would recommend it if you are looking for a syrup that will compliment your concoctions without overpowering it with sugar.,1
3008,"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again.",1
3010,"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.  First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.  Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.  I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?",1

3029,"Searching for a replacement for Ghirardelli's excellent but discontinued Expresso Escape bars, I tried these. Unfortunately I ordered 12 of them. I tried parts of 4 of these and could NOT detect ANY hints of chocolate OR coffee in any of them. I kept trying them because I could not believe what I was NOT tasting. Ended up throwing the rest away.",1
3030,"Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas. They all taste like ultra-fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me.  Switch is definitely NOT the case.  Finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines- who knew!  I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of  San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparking Beverage - 24/11.5 oz cans  but sweeter.  This, and ALL Switch beverages are highly recommended.",1
3032,"I requested two types of Chips Ahoy!'s newest cookies.  These were tasty, and the others were not.  So don't interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies... just these alone.  The cookies tasty chocolatey and don't have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type.  They are very sweet, but you can tell you're eating a chocolate cookie.  In moderation (I had two at most at a time) it's decent and easy snack.  They are very chewy, almost a dough consistency, but the cookie doesn't fall apart easily. I think the frosting center helps the cookie's structure.  Very good with a cup of black coffee.",1
3040,"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product.",1
3048,This is very tasty!  We have tried other k cup hot chocolates and feel this is the best option.,1
3049,"I first purchased Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie in the Caramel Apple flavor. While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and I have to say  it is tasty and fulfilling! It is my 2nd favorite cookie and I easily give them a 5 star rating!  I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!  I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! My only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn't forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor. Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how ""fresh"" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)",1
3053,"This has a great flavor.  If you are concerned about what you give your kids and don't like all the extras that are put into kids foods, you'll love this.

3057,I originally bought these to help get my husband's cholesterol down.  This is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal.  I even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go.  The Chocolate Brownie and Cranberry are our favorite varieties.,1
3074,"A pretty tasty cereal. Supposedly healthy and pretty chocolaty. Can't feel guilty eating this every morning. I'm a big fan of the whole mini-wheats line, and a big fan of chocolate, so this really hits the spot in the mornings. (FYI, if you really like chocolate too, consider Krave, thought I'm guessing it's not as healthy as mini wheats).",1
3075,These energy bars taste great and come in a variety of flavors. They are low in carbs which is what I need.,1
3083,"The can size is like a Redbull drink's.  However, its sugar content is 34 grams.  Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts.  In terms of its taste, in my opinion, it's quite tasty, sweet, a bit tangy and very orangish!",1

3096,"I bought Blue Sky Organic Black Cherry pop at a local health store along with their orange.  While I found the orange to taste a bit flat and un-orange, the black cherry was outstanding!  Just the right amount of sweet, not over powering at all.  I do not like my drinks to taste like they are full of high fructose corn syrup.  The cane juice gives it the taste it needs and a healthful reprieve from HFC.  The cherry flavor was decently bold and very refreshing.  I love that Amazon has this pop for sale and as an option for repete orders because I can't afford to buy it from the health store too often!",1
3101,"I'm not intolerant to gluten, but I do keep an eye out for healthy snack foods. These oat raisin walnut spice bars have an unusual consistency, rather like fruit cake, but they sure taste better than fruitcake! They're not overly sweet, and it's actually possible to detect the flavors of oats, raisins, walnuts, and spice (mainly cinnamon), and they go well with a nice, hot cup of tea.",1
3106,The fruit cake is very tasty and pricy (as all the good ones are). Glad I found it.,1
3107,I don't know if it gives me any more energy but it has a surprisingly natural flavor with very little (if any) after taste for a no calorie beverage.  You can really taste the blueberry.,1

I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.  I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.  5 stars.",1
3141,"I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.  Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.  It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.  Try the Kiwi Berry instead.",1
3142,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something I'd buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.  It wasn't as orangey as I expected and it wasn't until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why--orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.  When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola!! The only bonus of this over ""real"" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isn't much else nutritionally to speak of.",1
3144,"This chocolate is very smooth, rich, and full bodied in flavor. It makes great truffles, cookies, or whatever it's used for. Melts evenly and can be used for hot chocolate drinks too.",1
3146,This is a great product even though I am a health nut.  The Acai powder taste really good with my protein shake plus it has a high potency.  I will mix this powder with a chocolate protein shake and both taste and color changes which shows it's the real deal.  Even though it is a antioxidant product you have to eat right as well to feel the effect.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS really carefully put in the refrigerator after first use or else it will spoil.,1
3152,"Can be eaten on its own, not salty at all with each single serving porch.",1
3155,"There was a huge internet blow up over these candy corn Oreos. I love candy corn so I had to try them. I have only two Targets in my area and both were sold out. Luckily, Amazon has them available.  They have a slight taste of candy corn but not overwhelming. On the sweet side. Interesting. I really like the vanilla cookie taste, so I enjoyed them. My husband thought they were a bit too sweet for his tastes. More for me!",1
3167,"This is a very tasty flavored coffee.  The flavor is not overpowering, and provides an extra little kick of awesomeness.",1
3169,"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.",1
3171,"Great tasting and the added benefit is the fiber! My son loves granola, granola bars, etc. And with GF products it's really hard to find sources of fiber, this is wonderful and it has fiber!",1
3174,"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.  So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down.",1
3177,"I've been eating energy and protein bars for years.  Most are like flavored cardboard.  GFB bars don't just satisfy your hunger, they have outstanding taste and texture.  They aren't just for gluten free diets, but are a wonderful alternative snack for anyone.  Get some!!!",1
3184,"I was tentative ordering 44 kcups of this flavor but figured for $14.99 it was worth a try. I like these. For my taste they are not too sweet and I definitely am glad I got them. Not too watery even at the 8 oz setting. All in all, I like the flavor and am waiting for another deal. A little kalua is not bad at night either ;)",1
3190,"It's not a complete replacement for sugar, but it tastes great and substitutes for sugar more often than not.",1
3195,I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.,1
3199,I don't like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss.,1
3206,"I would like to try this, however I do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of, did I miss something? They only say what it is not! Would really like to know.",1
3216,This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...,1
3219,"This is better than chocolate!!I mix it along with stevia in yogurt, cottage cheese, almond butter...whatever I think of.  Also, makes awesome brownies.",1
3223,"These soda's taste great, while I've never had the original flavored I expect it to taste something like a sprite. Unlike American soda's like coke and dr. pepper these are fruit flavored and have FAR less sugar and sodium in them making them a much healthier choice of beverage; as healthy as a soda could possibly be that is. All flavors taste great and the bottle is 100% recyclable. I'd recommend them to anyone.",1
3227,"These sugars are so good! They make great, light, fluffy, cotton candy! They work extremely well compared to using hard candy. They all taste great! I would highly recommend these for anyone making homemade cotton candy! They taste as great as boardwalk cotton candy! :)",1
3229,"When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.  The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.  The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think I'll take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future.",1
3230,"Great product. No fat. All natural, nothing added. Great crunch and taste! Favorite company by far!",1
3234,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?",1
3242,I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!,1
3243,"i have a weak spot for grape soda (among other not so good for you treats). admittedly i don't pay that much attention to what goes into them, but i do try to moderate what i consume from time to time.  this stuff is great! tastes almost as deliciously bad for you as the real thing, but since it's not as syrupy as welch's grape soda, it actually is more refreshing after downing the whole can.  if you're concerned with all the bad stuff in the other stuff, but can't keep away, give this one a try.",1
3244,"Newman's Own Organics Licorice Twists have a lot of things going for them - 70 percent organic, with no artificial ingredients.  The pomegranate flavor was surprisingly good and, while it had a different consistency from the Twizzlers I'm used to, it wasn't a bad change.  Recommended.",1
3247,"These are a tasty item, and a great value.  I would say they are becoming a staple at our household. I wish the raspberry flavor was a bit more pronounced, but they are very fruity (not artificial) tasting.  Nice, short ingredient list, too!",1
3250,"I liked it well enough.  Not my all-time favorite, as I prefer my Trio bars (nuts & fruits) for breakfast, however, if you're a chocolate fan but feel guilty about eating candy, this is the product for you.",1
3254,"i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ...not gallon size =( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum ""double bubble"" i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting...",1
3256,"One of my guilty pleasures.  I've had baklava from many places and of many types.  I'm less enthused about those made with rose or orange flavored sugar water, and love that made with honey.  These are a spiced honey and walnut combination.  For those who prefer pistachios, however, these may not impress.",1
3259,"This is one of Zevia's more successful flavors.  It's more reminiscent of the flavor of Dr Pepper than a clone, but it still tastes very good.  I don't notice any kind of aftertaste.  I've bought this on its own before, and will again.  It's one of my favorite flavors.",1
3262,"I love this raw cacao. This is a really good value. This is so much more expensive in Whole Foods.  I make a banana ice cream/pudding with it that tastes amazing. 3-4 frozen bananas pureed with 1-2 teaspoons of raw cacao and a pinch of salt. I place it in the freezer for a bit to set. Simple, Healthy and toddler approved.",1
3263,"I use this product with my plain yogurt and add some fresh fruit, thus avoiding the "" fruit "" yogurts that have artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup. For those concerned with calories and sugars, this is a pleasant alternative.",1
3272,"If you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a ""package"" with the picture that is shown your good!  If you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own...then this is for you too.  I was very pleased with the assortment, and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time.  I purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor k-cup and I like variety.",1
3273,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it.",1
3275,"I drink Crystal Light like it was ...water!  This is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry/orange/grape, etc.  It is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be.  I do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors!",1
3276,I have tried many versions of Stevia and this one seems to taste the best.,1
3278,"These are my favorite dark chocolate.  I don't like overly sweet chocolates and love the combination of salt and dark chocolate.  These are very tasty and just the right size if you want to have a small daily dose of dark chocolate, but don't want to load up on calories.",1
3282,"I love the bitter taste of chocolate, so I did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa. I did however find one negative review saying that theobromide, the primary stimulant in cocoa, is unhealthy and has similar side-effects as caffeine. I got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself. While I did have a small crash afterwards (after 3 tablespoons), the surge in energy that I felt was definitely worth it. It was not the jittery surge I was warned about, and the crash actually helps me sleep if I time it right. Not to mention the taste is so good (and yet mild) that I could eat it by the spoonful on its own. Thinking that was the end of it, I also ordered cocoa nibs. Terrible mistake. I don't know exactly why, but I got the exact side-effects I was warned about, not to mention the energy was lower in quality. This is definitely the better alternative.",1
3286,"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.  I do not recommend this product.",1
3295,Loved the flavor of strawberry and rhubarb - texture perfect for me.  Definitely would order again.  A treat for me!,1
3318,"These are some awfully tasty donuts.  They consist of a fairly dense golden cake coated in chocolate.  They're small, but rather dense and rich.  They're always moist- probably because of some additive, but it's the additives that make them tasty.  This is something I can only stand to eat every so often, but on occasion, they are really delicious.",1
3320,Saw this on Dr. Oz so of course I had to try it.  Bitter....bitter....bitter - only way you could eat it was mixed with yogurt.  And...did it help increase my metabolism like Dr. Oz said it would?  Very doubtful.,1
3328,"The flavor of the two does not taste lie strawberries and vanilla in my opinion. For being naturally flavored they do have a ""manufactured"" taste. I tried one of each before giving the rest away......",1
3329,"The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...  EDITED TO ADD: I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price.",1
3336,"Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more.",1
3342,"We all have our vices, mine has always been chips.  Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!",1
3343,"While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children. If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?",1
3344,"I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go.",1
3352,"I'm not a big health freak and love soda and everything sugary and bad for you, but this stuff is incredible. Many people want to compare this to Izze, but Izze is only 70% compared to The Switch's 100%. And you can taste the difference in how natural the product is. Since I bought this to give up soda, the fizziness gives your brain a feeling that it's the same unhealthy soda you normally have, but the rest of your body will feel the difference. It definitely costs a bit more that a 24 pack of soda, but compared to Naked juice (the other delicious 100% juice beverage) it's a bargain deal.",1
3353,"Unusual and very tasty.  As you might expect, they taste like okra.  I wish they were a little less expensive, but I don't know of any alternative.",1
3358,"Switch Bev taste great, my fav was the grape but they all have a great taste.  Most important my kids love them!",1
3359,"Very good to flavor broth. I got this kind, genmai, because I cannot have gluten grains. No reactions so far.",1
3363,Very well balanced flavor with no after taste. Syrup does have the tendency to drip down the side while pouring so you may want to get a pump.,1
3367,I bought this as an impulse buy today. I'm really trying to cut out soda from my diet. I'm a Pepsi junkie I'll admit it and I have the waistline to prove it. So I brought my water bottle and honestly? I hate water. So I shot three squirts of this into a 24 oz bottle and....it's good. Tastes good. Mixes well. It is a tad pricey but it's either that or go back to my Pepsi. I like it. Recommended.,1
3372,"I am quite fond of these bars.  They aren't full of nasty ingredients like most commercial cereal bars.  The only downside is that they don't fill me up at all.  They are good as a snack, but I can't eat these for breakfast without being hungry soon afterwards.",1
3387,"Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually ""NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED"" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural. I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it.",1
3392,"I don't know how oats could vary, considering they are just one ingredient, but these are the best, tastiest, and perfect texture.  I thought I was crazy for thinking they tasted better than other, easier to locate brands, but then I read the other reviews and realized these oats really are the best!",1
3393,"This tasty cereal has everything going for it. It taste good and has 46 grams of whole grains, which is 96% of your daily minimum of whole grain needs from one bowl. It has a decent amount of fiber and calcium. Good for your morning breakfast or as a snack when you are on the run.",1
3402,"I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.  GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.  This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.  It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.  If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!",1
3404,"Good substitute for sugar, I like it much better than stevia, which to me has an awful after-taste. I did notice though that the Erythritol isn't quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive.",1
3411,This rice blend is very tasty and has nice chewy bits in it from the addition of the barley and rye berries.  I greatly enjoy it.,1
3417,Great tasting. Found the right combo for taste. Better than eating all that sugar. you will not be disappointed with this syrup.,1
3418,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each).",1
3432,"I got these from the grocery store when I couldn't have milk because of the baby. I had to have some chocolate. This is some really tasty chocolate. I mean real good. I can have milk now, but I still buy these. Love em'!",1
3435,"These Quaker Banana Bread bars are so tasty and I just love that they are low calorie, giving me a guilt free snack!",1
3437,"These are good! Each roll is only 45 calories with 2g of sugars. They are similar in consistency to a rice cake, but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup. I think they taste sweeter than the 2g of sugars they contain, but not so sweet that you'd consider them candy or junk. They come packaged 8 rolls to a box. Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes. These are certainly good enough to order more than once, but I imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order. A 6-box option might be better.",1
3454,"I love pineapples and these are wonderful.  They taste great, are easily portable and need no refridgeration which is good during the summer.  I also like the apple and Asian pears.  Not so cray about the strawberry bananas and the potato crisps",1
3469,"I like these because they're not too sweet. But of course that also means you can just keep eating and eating them without realizing how many you've plowed your way through, so be careful...  a three-cookie serving contains 140 calories and 5 grams of fat  Lots of fruit, and the citrus flavor REALLY comes through. And as they're thin and crisp, they're the perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea because they don't immediately go soggy. I'm not usually a big cookie person, but I'll probably be getting these again.",1
3491,This licorice has a very good flavor! The only thing I would have liked is it were a little softer.,1
3498,"This tonic water is the best! It does not contain high fructose corn syrup, so it tastes better. Buy it! You will not regret it!",1
3501,Will definitely buy again. I sent this to a deployed soldier who shared it with the other boys and they all love it! Great flavour.,1
3510,"This Maamoul has a good taste for both the date and the cookies It's soft and doesn't smell bad because of the packing, I recommend it.",1
3514,"I love Zevia soda, it has a weird aftertaste for some but I am in love with this soda that is good for you!  It does have a very citrusy taste!",1
3516,I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!,1
3520,"I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.  Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:  1. Watermelon Strawberry 2. Kiwi Berry 3. Black Cherry 4. Orange Tangerine",1
3526,"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus.",1
3532,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away.",1
3542,"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acaia, Natural Flavors and colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Soy. I was very surprised that this taste like a great Tangerine soda. Each can has 140 calories, 1orNo thanks I am  swimming from 15 mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 34g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C and 20 % of Vitamin A.  I would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange/Tangerine flavored juice again. I found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink. But for my money I would rather by the  IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)  brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories.",1
3543,"Even though sugar free, these candies taste as good as the sugared variety. Good mix of flavors in small packages.",1
3549,What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps.,1
3553,These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.,1

3571,"I'm a cherry nut! All the soda I drink has some sort of cherry flavour so I wanted to try this too. Great taste and how can I go wrong with Vitamin C thrown in for good measure? Will be most popular with those that already drink 'heathy' sodas, such as  airforce Nutrisoda Flex, Black Cherry and Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",1
3573,"I ordered this specifically b/c they said ""dark chocolate"" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!",1
3574,"I loved this cereal, so did all the family.  We just can't have it any more due to dietary restrictions, too much sugar.  Would love to have in the house again!",1
3575,"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.  This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.  FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.",1
3577,My wife has me order this item for her. We look like we are a small convinece store in our garage This is the only product she has found to have NO SWEETNER in it so it has flavor but 0 calories and no FAKE sweetner either. IF you get bored drinking water try Hint This flavor is her favorite,1
3579,"These are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids - Like regular gummy bears, but even better - with extra flavor. Perfect consistency....Not too chewy... great all the way around.",1
3587,This brand has a wide variety of flavors.  This makes a great gift or when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth.,1
3596,"This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be ""100% juice,"" but this drink has some kick.  There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.  It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.",1
3608,"These sugar-free sour gummi worms are wonderful. The taste is just like that of the regular sour gummi worms. The only problem with them is that they did not come with a suggested serving size. As you may or may not know, if you eat too much of these or most sugar-free products, there may be unintended... consequences. Limit 4 to 6 at a time, or you may find yourself limited to the bathroom. Other than that, they are great.",1
3610,I bought my first RJ's soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice I have ever tasted!!,1
3612,I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these cookies. They are individually wrapped so they stay fresh. They are sweet enough but not over sweet. They aren't overpowering.  Everyone who has tried them agrees with this analysis. We had sweet amaretti cookies in Italy this summer and these can stand up to those. So Mangia!,1
3615,Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.,1
3618,Nothing... and I mean absolutely nothing compares to these. Semi-hard chocolate shell outside and incredibly smooth chocolate inside. It's heaven in a box. Godiva DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE.  The absolute best chocolate ever.,1
3622,Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.,1
3627,"Good stuff. It has a better, more natural flavor than the Kraft version in my opinion.",1
3638,I love the taste of this soda. It's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. I'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone.  My only complaint would be the serving size. It's correct for a serving size but not what I'm used to in a soda can. (12 oz.),1
3641,"Purchased this elsewhere for more money- won't do that again! Mainly use it for Gluten-free cookies, etc.  Love it! Susie C.",1
3659,"I'll admit that I don't care for drinks that are carbonated - the carbonation in soda makes me burp, they tend to be too sweet, or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I drank this.  To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild - it's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you won't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo  - stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesn't like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.  I'm not sure when you would drink this though - it's a small can and I can't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead - especially at the price they charge for this. Are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning?  Overall I think it's tasty and if someone offered me one, I'd take it, but it's not something I would buy.",1
3660,I received my box of Pure Natural Bars right before going on a long road trip. I took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while I traveled. I am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and I didn't feel like I was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients. The mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over-sweetened snack bars.  Pros: - Natural Ingredients - Pleasant Texture - Great Taste  Cons: - Wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky  Overall I recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients.,1
3663,"This tastes great and I like that it's more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, it's a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though.",1
3679,"I'm usually into Pineapple and coconut drinks, but this drink just didn't taste all that great to me. The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks.",1
3695,"I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents.",1
3697,a great little candy - tastes good - really fruity and not too sugary! my 2 yo son loves them (allergic to wheat and dairy),1
3703,This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!,1
3721,"A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.  I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.  This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.",1
3726,These cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is 300 for one cookie--this is a bit high!,1
3741,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.,1
3751,Gluten free corn thins are incredibly tasty and low in calories. They are a good replacement for bread or any crackers.,1
3753,"This stuff tastes great.  I wasn't expecting much when I mixed it with my orange juice, but I was wrong.  I can't claim any miracles in the health department, but I haven't had any recent cholesterol checks either.  It makes a delicious smoothie, and I will continue to use it because I read and believe the studies on acai.",1
3759,We've been using this syrup for years and now so easy to have it delivered right to our door. Wife is diabetic and we really watch her carbs (she's been able to stay off shots for 4 years now with products like this). We can't tell any taste difference from regular (we used to before the new sweeteners came out) We have noticed when we ask for sugar free syrup when we eat out this is the ONLY brand restaurants carry.,1
3762,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck,1
3774,"Thought I'd give these a try because I was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that's high in protein, low-fat and great tasting.  Well these are high in protein(which I like), are low in fat(which I like), but I think in their processing to make it low-fat they compromised on the flavor. I was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste. Artificial!!  I will not buy these again.  I'm stuck now with the whole box. My hunt continues for that great snack bar.",1
3786,This product is a nice alternative to pasta or potatoes.  Its very tasty and extremely easy to heat.  The fact that is already precooked makes it even more enjoyable for me.,1
3803,Great taste!  Different than any ice tea we have had!  Kids love it!  All natural sugar.  Will buy again,1
3806,I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.,1
3807,"Quite good.  I would definitely order this again.  Nice sized roe. A little soft, meaning, not a lot of ""pop"", but still quite good for the price.",1
3811,"O.N.E. Coconut water is by far the best tasting coconut water I've had (and I've had just about every brand out there).  The great taste lets me hydrate my body better than regular water, 'cause if O.N.E. wasn't available, I would not be able to palate drinking coconut water.",1
3828,"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting.",1
3829,"I was a little hesitant to buy the cocoa bean flavor after reading the reviews saying that it's not the same as chocolate, because most of the proteins I've been using are chocolate flavored.  I'm glad I ended up with cocoa bean.  I took the advice of some other comments to heat it up and it really does taste good as hot chocolate.  The other thing I like about it is that it mixes very well with water.  When I'm at the gym I don't really have a choice between water and milk, but it's not a problem with this protein.",1
3830,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa.",1
3831,"These treats were surprisingly tasty and filling.  140 calories per serving (3 cookies).  But the cookies were really the perfect size for a light snack. These had more of a gingerbread taste than a honey taste, but that isn't a bad thing.  Allergy alert:  contains soy product.",1
3843,"My kids love them, and is affordable and convenient, delivered to my home, and the peace of mind that I am feeding them organic... A HIT!!",1
3848,"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one.",1
3849,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients. NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.,1
3851,"We use this ketchup all the time at our house in order to cut down on sugar.  It tastes just like the regular ketchup to us.  The bottle with the wide head is handy, because you can easily store it upside down.  That makes it easier to squirt out the remaining ketchup.",1
3852,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.,1
3853,I really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then I would like. The Gustaf's rounds are a little better.,1
3854,I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program  This Lipton to go decard tea is good and is refreshing.  I wished it had less ingredients but overall is a better alternative to soda pop. And less calories.,1
3855,"For a low gluten product this stuff is very good.  It holds up well in liquid, doesn't get all mushy. I like the bits of dried fruit.  I add stevia for sweetness.",1
3866,"tasty and soft.  my toddler just loves them.  they are a little pricey, and there are very few fruit snacks in a bag.",1
3868,"So far I like this cherry juice best.  I was expecting it to be thinner and watered down compared to the concentrate (I had been mixing Tart is Smart concentrate 1/2 cup per Qt of water which I believe is what they suggest) but this tastes much better and stronger.  Perhaps tastes better because it tastes stronger to me.  The tart cherry juice works better than Glucosamine for me, my knees creak far less and I am much more limber when I wake up.  I can't say anything about sleeping better as I slept fine before I started drinking cherry juice.",1
3876,Tastes much better than the whey protein powders I've tried in the past and doesn't leave a nasty aftertaste.  Blends well by simply shaking.  I use with almond or soy milk.,1
3888,"I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.  The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.  What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.",1
3889,I ordered this for my diabetic daughter.  I found some not so great reviews from people  so I only ordered one bottle.  My whole family loves this stuff!!!  I even like it and I am not a sno-cone fan.  It has an excellent flavor!  The syrup is light and doesnt overtake the ice.  I will order all of my syrups from Back to Basics sugar free collection from now on.  I highly reccoment this product!!!!,1
3894,"These bars kick fruit butt!  They really are one of the best ""breakfast"" bars that I have ever tasted, plus they appear to be somewhat healthy which is always good.  I can eat one of these for breakfast and be satisfied.",1
3899,"The South Beach Diet Bar (Dark Chocolate) offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat.  It has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories.  Don't expect it to taste like candy - this is a granola bar, after all - but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight.  While the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste, the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire.  If the rest of losing weight could only be this easy!",1
3904,"I am by no means a granola connoisseur, but this stuff is pretty darn tasty.  This product is made with all natural ingredients. There honestly isn't a lot of chocolate in it -- just the right amount. It's dark chocolate but isn't too bitter or too sweet. Overall it's just a very nice blend and tastes delicious. Maybe a little pricey, but not a dealbreaker when considering it's made with real ingredients. I'd say 5/5 for taste, 3/5 for value. Recommended.",1
3907,I do Bikram Yoga almost every day and this is by far the best rehydrating drink I have had. It's so refreshing and one of these after class cures my thirst.,1
3912,We had a yard sale and sold snow cones with Hawaiian Shaved Ice snow cone syrups! It was a huge hit! I especially liked the choice of 10 flavors...I will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over!,1
3918,"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.  It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".  To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.  And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst.",1
3919,"Do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup??? i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber, its so much better for your baby.",1
3920,"I tried these before ordering them in bulk and cheaper from Amazon.com.  They are a great nut snack with very low sugar content and high protein content.  While a bit dry, they have good flavor and are good for you.  Much better than most so called energy bars.  And reasonably priced if ordered in bulk through Amazon.com.",1
3923,"In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.  Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.  I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.  Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame.",1
3930,We need to buy these for one of our children who has special needs and the price on Amazon can't be beat.,1
3933,"I'm glad I read the reviews saying to only use a few drops in a beverage. Too many drops and it quickly goes from delicious to strange and bitter. The directions on the bottle say 5-8 drops, but I find 2 or 3 is perfect in a 12 oz drink or a cup of yogurt.",1
3935,"the other ones are really good -- just cherries, for example  just cranberries taste like nothing and are impossible to chew on.  no sweetness.. no tartness.. no bitterness... taste like eating cotton",1
3942,"I typically by these juice boxes in the store for $3.49-$3.99 for a pack of 8.  I should have checked with the seller on tha actual count, but was shocked that they are selling the same box for $14 and change! Lesson learned, and I am very disappointed.  On the other hand, my kiddos love the drinks and I love that they don't have as much sugar as the other drinks.",1
3943,"I am disappointed in this product. First, there's a distinct aftertaste. Secondly, it is not as sweet as they promise, and doesn't work at all in cold drinks.  If you need a sugar substitute I suggest Somersweet, not perfect either but better than this.   Sorry I was taken in by the promises.",1
3946,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.  Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.",1
3951,"It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.  Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.  In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.  As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Holicks, it's just a great comfort drink.",1
3952,"Buy it now, please. These are just great, with perfect flavor and texture. I keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing. Try them with different things: in salads, with crudite, with good dark chocolate, with your tea in the morning, as we do. A+++",1
3963,I just love the taste of this tea. The weird thing is it cuts your craving for sweets. I drank it in the morning and before bed and lost 20 lbs.,1

3975,I've been a NuGo bar fan for years.  This special flavor is my new favorite.  It's a great blend between banana and chocolate.  Great texture and taste.  And I love that this has such a high amount of protein compared to the other bars.,1
3980,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.  Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.  I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.  I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.",1
3983,"I tried this product because I have relatives who are diabetic and I'm always looking for low carb alternatives. The muffins have a somewhat cornbread kind of taste, and were a little dull in taste. I added a few frozen blueberries and this helped a lot.  My only complaint is that these mixes are quite expensive, and I may not be able to order as many as I would  like. They will have to be a treat rather than a staple....too bad.",1

4001,"This granola is a mix of rolled oats and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  I couldn't find a description on the bag as to whether it's a snack or a cereal.  As a snack, it's a bit dry for my taste and isn't as sweet as the delicious Quaker 100% Natural, but I quite enjoyed it with milk.  Its crunchy texture is just right and the chocolate is a treat.  If you like granola, this is a good one.  A good source of fiber.",1
4002,"So glad to find this product at a sensible price.  A bit less flavor, being ""light,"" but still a good taste and so much better for you than many alternatives.",1
4005,"Yeah it's gluten free and whatever, but unless that's a really big issue for you and you're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, there's no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I don't appreciate that either. Not a fan.",1
4006,"Don't be fooled buy the calorie count on this product, most people consider low calorie products to be less filling. I'm surprised at this tasty and filling meal in a can. I purchased this item on a whim, and glad that I did. Will purchase again for sure.",1

It has 180 calories and 30g of protein! Low sugar compare to other drinks. I drink it once/day after a 1 hour workout for five days a week. The chocolate tastes great. No need to add the extras like ice, juices, or fruits for better taste. Instantly stopped my hunger for a couple of hours. Gives me a good amount of energy. Not gassy! The packets are great for traveling. UPDATE - 3/10/11 So far, chocolate it the best flavor. Vanilla tastes like lite sweet milk. Haven't tried strawberry yet.",1
4030,"I love my hot chocolate, But this one is very weak, I have to add a little syrup to give it a more chocolate taste.",1
4033,"This has a strong granny smith apple taste. I eat apples all the time, so if anyone says otherwise they are mistaken. Same texture, just a different and better taste. Now I'm purchasing three packs a week because it taste so good. Tasty enough to substitute an unhealthy dessert for this tasty treat.",1

Great taste, like a children's version of a mojito.  I drink a lot more water/liquid each day because of these little packets.  Great alternative to diet soft drinks and water.",1
4095,"A coworker just brought these into the office--surprisingly good! Sweet and tangy with a good crunch, unlike dried pineapple but not too greasy. wow! Definitely check these out if you get a chance.",1
4098,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.  I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.",1
4099,"I like it!  It's got the same after taste as the granulated, if you're wondering.  I find it pleasant.  Used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness (and actually once it was in coffee, to me it was the same flavor as sugar - with no aftertaste). I don't like splenda very much and can't stand sweet n low. Been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt. Excited!  Didn't realize it had to be refrigerated, but that was just my own ignorance.  Was hesitant, but now I highly recommend the SweetLeaf stevia clear!",1
4106,"These are delicious, it's been hard to find a good stewed tomato,the kind my mom used to can.  This is very close. A real fresh tomato taste and seasoned perfectly. Other brands have a tinny taste to them and usually are too sweet.",1
4109,"Small, just right for a little something sweet.  Ginger flavor is good, it comes on gradually until it is almost intense.  A bargain.",1
4114,"I am already a fan of Newman's Own Organics line of products.  I think they are generally high quality, reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization.  So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice.  When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate.  The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.  Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.  So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend.",1
4117,i've used stevia for a long time and love the natural product.  this is a good price as I normally spend around $15 for only one bottle half the size of these 4 oz ones.,1
4119,"We used to raise Montmorency cherries, and these dried cherries are the real deal. As dried fruit, they're perfect: moist, chewy, and wonderfully flavorful. They make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office. Though I generally don't like added sugar on dried fruits, it's really necessary to counteract the cherries' naturally tart taste. Reconstituted, I'm guessing they'd be perfect for tart cherry pies. Certainly the flavor is everything I remember in a really good tart cherry pie, which is almost impossible to find these days.",1
4120,I really like these bars.  The only downside is that they contain Maltitol and half of the protein is Soy.  I am not a big soy fan. Peanut butter is the best.,1

4122,"In my attempt to buy healthier snacks that don't have high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners and processed sugar, I discovered these Raw Revolution bars.  They are GREAT!  We've tried several flavors and love them.  They are great for on-the-go snacks and are made with whole ingredients.",1
4132,"This drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we've had that are made of powder.  The directions don't tell you how much to squeeze into your water, so I would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste.  You can always add more.  The only concern I have about it is there is caffeine in it and I really don't want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning.  You might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children.",1
4136,Walnuts are an extremely healthy snack if eaten in moderation (one serving is 200 calories).  I especially like them as a salad topper.,1

4185,"The Tanka Bars I purchased were moist, solid, tasty without too much salt or sweetener, and a small amount alleviated hunger for several hours at a time. As I diabetic type II I often have hunger pangs throughout the day. Pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift. This helped me maintain a steady blood glucose level all day. A little bit goes a long way so it should not be gobbled like an energy bar. The taste will tempt you to do so. It is pricey, but certainly worth it. I keep several in my Go-Bag.",1
4198,I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better.  Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.  The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.,1
4208,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?",1
4214,This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.  What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.,1
4218,"zico probably has the best taste of the coconut water brands I've tried.  This passion fruit flavor is great, refreshing & not too sweet.  I'm not a fan of the unflavored kinds.  I've tried zico's mango but prefer the passion fruit over it.",1
4219,"I'm a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days, so this beverage idea really sounded good to me.  It doesn't contain a bunch of artificial junk in it, and it still tastes pretty good.  I could definitely drink more of these.  They won't ever be my favorite beverage, but then I'm more of a non-carbonated kind of drinker anyway.  This is definitely a good alternative to other products out there, and I'd like to try other flavors as well.",1
4224,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).  My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver.",1
4228,5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili. The only thing that concerns me is the 11 grams of sugar. That can't be good for you.,1
4235,I love the KIND bars.  They taste great and are much healthier than other bars.  Also they satisfy your taste for something sweet so are healthier than eating candy.,1
4239,"I like Nature Valley granola bars because they fill me up better than other brands, such as Special K or the Quaker Oats granola bars. They're also chewy and sweet, great for a snack or a quick breakfast. My only complaint is that it is a little too sweet.",1
4259,Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.,1
4298,"I love this stuff! I could drink it all day long! Nice and smooth going down and extremely refreshing! The amount you get for the price is just perfect. I have caught flack because it is ""expensive"" but this is the best Coconut Water on the market.",1
4303,"I tried another of these Switch products and was less than pleased, but maybe it was the flavor which I think was supposed to be watermelon. The black cherry went down a lot easier although it's still a tad too acidic for me. But it tastes good, you know, like black cherry.  Brian W. Fairbanks",1
4307,"I have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this. Not homemade, not from starbucks, not from Swissmiss... This is hands down the best I've ever had. I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.  But what happened to the price? Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5-star review will return.",1
4325,"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.  This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version.",1
4330,"""These were very good. Bought three 36 count boxes and only two pieces were a little bit hard on the top layer of the petite four. Would not hesitate to buy again, very, very good.""",1
4341,"There's nothing wrong with this drink, but it really just tastes like any other orange soda.  Kudos to The Switch for not adding artificial flavors, sugar, or corn syrup, though.  It tastes pretty clean and refreshing, but a bit expensive for what it is.  Don't let the small-sized can (8.3oz) fool you, this isn't an energy drink, it's just an orange soda.",1
4344,"These are going to be a hit at my wedding.  Haven't tried them yet, but who doesn't love a Hershey Kiss?!?!?!",1
4352,"I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy. If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don't order these.  Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global. They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa. Very adult and superb.",1
