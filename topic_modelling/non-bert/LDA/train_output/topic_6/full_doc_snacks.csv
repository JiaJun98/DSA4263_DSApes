4,These are good chips.  I like the texture and that they are easier to chew than regular tortilla chips.  Especially good with some salsa.,0
6,Love this stuff - 1st try used shaker cup to mix - would recommend using electric wand mixer to create milkshake effect - and the chocolately taste is yummy,0
31,At the Hodgson Mill website they are seling a case of 6 for the same price.  talk about rip-offs.,0
37,"I enjoy the flavor and benefits of fresh wheat grass but it is difficult to keep on hand. This powder seems to offer the same ""punch"" as well as tasting good. I'm very pleased with the product and now rely solely on it.",0
40,Purchased this water at first due to the fact I needed the water bottle to fit into a drink holder/case.  It was a win win situation because it tasted great too!,0
44,This was the 2nd time I tried Pamela's bread mix & it's the closest to regular bread that I have found.  Great Product.,0
45,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,0
49,"I was a little bit hesitant to order this many boxes of potato dumplings without knowing the brand. It turns out that the taste and texture is very similar to the brand names,excellent! For an off-brand the price is too high, but altogether a great product for those who miss their Knoedel on the plate next to the roast and gravy!",0
54,"I was not impressed with these cookies when I tried them, when they first came out and the company had only one flavor. I did not care for them but I knew that something more satisfying could be had because I'd tried others.  I have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that I love and they my friends, cooking students, and neighbors have really enjoyed. If you're looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies, I suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in The Gluten Free Almond Flour Cookbook, Make It Paleo, and on Elana Amsterdam's web site.",0
59,This is the best pre-packaged Wasabi I have found. It has a great texture too. I only buy this now that a friend recommended it and I tried it.wa,0
60,"I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend.",0
61,This is a very good mix at a reasonable price. I snack on trail mix at work and put 1 of these out in the snack area with the standard pretzels and candy. My fellow employees must have liked since it was gone within a day,0
85,"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to ""pop"" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again.",0
86,My wife is now addicted to this.  She uses it to make her own style of salad dressing and of course it is great for making garlic bread.  This is too good.  We need to buy another one real soon.,0
90,"Our family loves these chips, they are light, not too greasy, and the seaweed taste is fantastic. My wife is from Japan so she turned us on to these chips.",0
107,"This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good. Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried. These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch. I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick. I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips. All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.  The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!",0
110,"I love VitaMuffins, but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $6.29.  Instead I bought the mix, 3 boxes for $16.00, and each box makes 12 muffins. Instead of $1.62 per muffin, the mix only requires water & eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin, and very easy to make. That's a great deal.",0
112,"This is fantastic corn, you don't need to add a thing to it, it is perfect right out of the can. Of course a couple of the cans were dented, to be expected with shipping. I am just sure to use those quickly. Great price with subscribe and save.",0
116,"These almonds are the best. I love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as I had hoped. I do eat lots of hot items so perhaps my taste buds are expecting more. Having said that, the flavor and freshness is tops.",0
124,"This ""Brachs Assorted Halloween Melocream Candy is available at Big M Stores for $1.19 per 11oz bag! I get them every year as a tradition. they have Chocolet Bats, Maple Jugs & Corn Stalks, Banana Half Moons & Corn Ears as well as traditional Candy Corn flavored Pumpkins.",0
128,"We recently fell in love with Indian food.  Papads (after quickly toasted in a HOT oven) can be a healthy alternative to potatoe chips.  They are excellent alone or dipped in chip dip.  They are a very thin bread.  When cooked they are brittle and crisp, just like potatoe chips.  However they are baked, not fried and made of chickpea flour which is a little more healthy than potatoe chips.",0
146,By removing the sodium from this drink it becomes a wonderful alternative to citrus juices.  If you prefer more tang add lemon juice or fresh cracked pepper.,0
155,"It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.  Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a ""whole lot of shaking"".  Most of the ""coating"" and ""flavoring"" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are ""sealed"", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day.",0
156,"Not exactly perfect for extreme low-carb dieting, but still good enough compared to your average sugar-infused muffin mix. Flavor is pretty good, though the muffins are lacking something to round them off, but they are moist and have a good texture.",0
157,i loved these peanuts they were just so good all of them and they came just as advertised.,0
158,"Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter.",0
163,Just a little pricy but worth having.  Made from corn much better than the rice  If you haven t tried this I would strongly suggest you give it a  try and by buying it 12 at a time it also saves you money,0
165,"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again! I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.",0
184,"I bought this product because I am on a medically supervised liquid diet. This product was recommended for adding low-calorie, low fat flavor to the shakes I am drinking. It is very tasty and adds great flavor. I have heard that you can add water and make a sort of peanut butter, but I have not tried that. I think it would also be excellent in baked goods too. This product also comes in a chocolate flavor, which is very good also.",0
192,"Good value, easy to dispense and they taste great.  My husband has them for a snack every day and has me reorder when they start getting down.  He wants them on hand.",0
197,"I loved this bread.  Very tasty with a good texture and taste.  I tried making something similar from scratch and it didn't turn out anything like this bread.  Slices great warm or cold.  I bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding ""Yes, we like this"" when I brought her in a loaf.  Freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese.  My boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting.  She said it was outstanding and wanted more (am I surprised, no).  Would highly recommend if you want a good Italian style bread.  I made mine in my horizonetal Wolfgang Puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting.  I tried all other settings, light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless.",0
198,"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy.",0
200,I have been a fan of Pamela's Products baking mixes for awhile now. This bread mix is one of my favorites. It is really healthy and easy to work with. I am always guaranteed good tasting bread when I use this mix. I really think it a good deal for healthy quality food. I don't have a lot of time to bake from scratch but I do like home made break so this is a good compromise.,0
206,"Adds flavor to all sorts of dishes.  Great for deviled eggs, mix with the yoke filler and top it off with a slice of jalepeno.",0
212,"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side. One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.  We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.  Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.  We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock. These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.",0
229,"I will definitely order this again. It melts in your mouth. The texture is light. When I brought it to work, the whole bag disappeared in minutes.",0
238,"This is a really good deal on some high quality chia seeds. There really isn't much more to say, if you use chia seeds these are a great buy.",0
242,"I keep a few of these in my desk at work for days when I don't feel like going out to lunch. They are super convenient because you can microwave them as is, just tear open slightly to vent and put in the microwave. No bowl required, just a spoon, or in a pinch, tilt your head back and slurp it!  The taste is great. I love Indian food, and I love vegetables so this is perfect for me. The only thing to mention is that one of my co workers complained about the smell, but he's that sorta complainy person who doesn't eat Indian food and prefers Burger King. It tastes great, smells great, and is super convenient.",0
246,"Just the right mix of chocolate, caramel and crunchy popcorn; very tasty. Plus the box is separated into 5 130-calorie packages so you don't sit down and eat the whole box at once.",0
252,I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.,0
254,"While the product is delicious, it's annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. You need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet.",0
267,The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended!,0
269,"I tried to ""cook"" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product ""popped up"".  The ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor.  Unfortunately, they were not returnable, so the rest will be going to the trash.  Waste of $$$.",0
272,"The can says it's 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.  So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.  I did not like it.",0
277,"This sunflower tastes really great, very original flavor not over salted. And the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large. Overall, it is the best sunflower seed that I ever eat in America.",0
291,"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS.",0
292,This is the best Rum Cake I've ever tasted.  The first time I had this was  in the Cayman Islands. To know I can stay here and still get them is even better!,0
311,I was anxious to try making my own ijera at home after living in Ethiopia for 15 months and have had fairly good success with this tef flour.  It is the dark variety but I enjoy the great almost mocha flavor.  I can tell it is fresh because it develops a good sour starter on its own without needing to add any additional sourdough starter  or yeast.,0
313,I took this stuff on a two week camping trip and had no problems with mess or attracting ants!  Tastes great. Note that this does not seem to reconstitute into a thick viscus honey-like substance. My results were much more watery  Use in place of sugar.,0
314,"Great portion control, nice that you dont have to keep it in the fridge or freezer. I'm reordering some right now :)",0
320,"Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad that's all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either.",0
328,The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.,0
336,"This is mostly dry croutons with very little flavor. I need to try to find some way to salvage this mix as no one will eat it the way it is right now. I was expecting something more like Chex Party Mix, but was greatly disappointed. It should have much more flavor/spice to be enjoyable as a snack mix. As it is, it has less flavor than a bag of salad croutons or plain pretzels.",0
340,My grandson loves the strawberry Kellogg's Special K Bars but the strawberry flavored are sometimes difficult to find in the grocery store.  I was thrilled to find them on amazon and be able to buy them by the case on a regular basis.  Heaven forbid that Nana be caught without a strawberry breakfast bar at all times!,0
344,I found these at BJ's Wholesale Club and really liked the taste.  They are very crunchy and chocolaty and the portion size is good.,0
357,"My girlfriend and I are regular drinkers of flavor-pack enhanced water (read:  hate plain water).  I saw ads for this on TV and figured I'd give it a try.  I have to say we both hate the taste and it by far does not add nearly enough flavor to water no matter how much you put it.  I would not recommend[ this product at any price, go with the classic powder flavor packs;  [ASIN:B001EQ4HEE Crystal Light On The Go Fruit Punch Drink Mix, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]]",0
359,"This is the cake part, you need to add your own Amaretto to it. And it really beats making your own!",0
397,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her.",0
398,"I've tried other root beer popsicles before, but they were not as close to being as good as A&W's. It was very easy. I just put them in the freezer, and then after dinner my family eats them.",0
407,"My parents love this stuff (and they're actually Asians, so that speaks volumes).  It's such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and I haven't nothing but ""white people"" food lying around.  But I'm sure that it'll go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well.  I think that it's a perfect combination of flavor for price.  But I have to admit that I would not purchase this item at Amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an Asian grocery.  If you found this review helpful, please let me know.",0
408,"I haven't been able to find this in any store lately. I had some a few years ago, and it is REALLY GOOD.  This is more like coffee cake than anything else.  The swirl is a cinnamon sugar with small pecan pieces, and the bread is sort of like yellow cake.  I'm excited to find it on Amazon.",0
413,"I wasn't sure that we would be able to find a powdered milk that my family would like, but this is it.  We'd gladly use this product on a regular basis if the price was a little lower.  Powdered whole milk doesn't have as long of a shelf-life as non-fat so this should be taken into consideration for long-term food storage.",0
418,"I liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas.  They are not spicy, but the taste is not bland because of the olives. The chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick, satisfying snack.",0
421,"this is my favorite flavor of crystal lite but i couldn't find it anywhere, thankfully i could get a huge batch of it on amazon so it will last me quite a while. thank you!",0
444,"What else can I say, other than this drinking water tastes great. The bottle is quite large, at 1.5 liter, it's almost the size of a 2 liter bottle of soda.",0
466,This product was very tasteless and boring. I felt like I was eating packaging material..awful awful awful awful!!!!!! Very bland!!!,0
482,Looking for a quick cook sticky toffee pudding these caught my eye. The only thing that resembles a sticky toffee pudding from this product though is the name. Bland tasting. A disappointment beyond words.,0
491,"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more.",0
492,"This tea didn't do anything, steal have issues with itching throat, ear and everything else. But I do enjoy the smell of it.. ill say it last up to a few hours and that's it.",0
501,"I admit I have a hard time identifying differences in most bottled water, unless they have some funky aftertaste. But this water is different. It tastes exceptionally clean and crisp. No chemical tastes, no salty taste, just very refreshing water. I like the large size of the bottles, as carrying one of these as I go out would guarantee I meet my water quota for the day. I poured some for my five year old granddaughter and she said, ""You have good water at your house, Granny."" so I guess there is a difference. When it's good, it's good!",0
513,"Not what I expected at all, there is no punch to these chips like I thought there would be. Not spicy or hot but rather just disgusting. The flavor is off and the after taste is god awful. I ate one corn chip and decided I did not care for them so I ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth, because that is what these chips taste like, and I can still taste these poo chips.  I will not be buying these chips again at all.  There blue corn chips are really great, but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off.",0
522,This device's lid does not seal.  I am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan.  Did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation.,0
528,these chewables are delicious. Do not know about the results of lowering cholesterol...I will have to wait until the next Dr. exam. yum,0
536,"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.",0
542,when i first bought this product i thought instant cornmeal it csnnot be that tasty! wow i cud not believe it it tasted like the real thing. very easy  to travel around with and a small flask of hot water. Very filling.,0
546,It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.,0
547,"I have been a david seeds fan since I was a kid, I didnt think anyone could beat their seeds. Since trying Bigs seeds Buffalo wing I now have a new favorite. The seeds are a little spicy but you can eat a whole bag wihout it leaving your tongue raw. I have tried all the flavors but Buffalo wing is my favorite.  Try them you will be surprised. I am not a young kid I have 45 years of sunflower seed eating experience.",0
549,"I am allergic to peanuts, but I can eat all other nut butters.  I like the taste of this product, and the soy bits give it a texture like crunchy peanut butter.  I recommended it for those who are allergic to peanuts.",0
550,We have used the pork pouch on porkt chops...and believe it or not...we have used it on chicken.  Both were juicy and had a great flavor.  Easy to use without a lot of mess...you can't go wrong with shake-n-bake.,0
551,"Since moving towards a more natural lifestyle, I have found cashews to be in quite a few recipes, so I was so happy when I saw this great deal!",0
552,"The soup really tastes great.  It is so convenient to throw one in your purse to take for lunch, etc and it was a great buy!!",0
558,"This is the brand I normally buy, but the price on Amazon is less than half of supermarket price.  I bake bread all the time, and the expiration date on these is February, 2013. Will buy again. Thanks Amazon for a very good deal.",0
563,"This coconut water takes great!  I've tried many other brands, and this is one of my favorites.  And, I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about the expiration dates.  I just ordered two boxes from Amazon, and the expiration date is Dec 7, 2012 (so 6 months from now).",0
564,"Great product, but boy did I waste money buying this from Amazon. It only cost $1.59 in the local asian supermarket.",0
568,"This is the best product ever for making chili!  Delicious, simple and easy!  But this price is ridiculous!  We can get it for $1.12 at Walmart.",0
569,It is what I wanted. Loaded with tender dried fruit and nuts. I'll order again.,0
577,I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.,0
584,"I tried Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise courtesy of Amazon Vine and really enjoyed it. There's lot of variety in the cereal, with all sorts of granola and cereal-type pieces. I'm not skilled enough at forensic cerealogy to identify all of them, but I do know enough to say that they all tasted great. This is a great breakfast treat, and it even works as a snack if you are so inclined.",0
586,"I eat oatmeal almost every morning in the fall and winter, this is by far my favorite variety pack. I stock up when it is on sale because I can go through a box a week. The variety pack is nice because it keeps it from getting monotonous. Peaches and cream is the tastiest and nothing beats hot oatmeal after shoveling snow or walking the dog.",0
588,fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover,0
590,Nuttzo makes great nut butters. Their chocolate version is like Nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. Delicious and super-nutritious.,0
595,Easy mix.  Great taste.  Works well with my bread machine and makes large loaves.,0
601,"Well, I am neither British, nor British-born, but I absolutely love Marmite.  It is an acquired taste and one that produces very strong reactions indeed!  Their ""Love It Or Hate It"" ad says it all in fact.  As a proof of this, I have two dogs: one loves marmite sandwiches, the other one starts sneezing when she feels the smell of it.  My recipe for the perfect breakfast: marmite soldiers and soft boiled egg. Delicious!",0
602,I bought these years ago at Walmart and then they stopped carrying them.  I was searching the internet and found them at Amazon.  We ordered a box of each.  I like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal.  A learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave.  They are great and we love them.,0
613,"These microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave!  My husband and I love the hot & spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor.  The only drawback I see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful (at least 1100 watts), the pork rinds do not cook as well.",0
616,"I've tried other nut butters in the past, but couldn't get past the grainy texture and the ho-hum taste. This one changed all that! I LOVE crunchy peanut butter, and this crunchy almond butter did not let me down. Very creamy texture (no graininess AT ALL)with a robust nutty flavor, with nice substantial almond pieces throughout. It works well in a dip I make, and is wonderful in sandwiches. It spreads easily and thankfully isn't separated with a layer of oil on top like other nut butters I've tried. This product will replace peanut better in my house! My favorite lunch is an almond butter and blackberry jam sandwich on pumpernickel bread...drool....",0
634,"This is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given. We love these since they're only 100 calories each and perfect for a snack, pair with a sandwich, or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry.",0
638,"For the past 5 years, my husband has been experimenting with making whole grain pancakes. He is constantly trying new whole grain pancake mixes out on the family. We were visiting some friends in Brooklyn when he discovered the Kodiak Cakes at a small deli. He bought the box and made them for us and we couldn't believe how amazing these whole grain pancakes are. They are super tasty and made with amazing ingredients. Hands down the best whole grain pancake mix I have ever had. We bought 12 boxes to start giving away as gifts when we go to someone's house (instead of giving a bottle of wine)!",0
660,"Usually, healthy food is hard to swallow. Not these, fresh, crunchy, delicious pumpkin seeds. I switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate. What do I know? I'm taking her word for it.",0
662,"Great product, with nice big chunks.  Not like other granola that gets broken into little, itty bitty pieces.",0
677,"I love these crackers and keep them on hand all the time.  They are great for soups, cheese and cracker snacks, to spread peanut butter on,  just plain, or ..... They are like chips ... can't eat just one !! I have them on subscribe & save and they always arrive safely and on-time.  A bit of trivia: our parrots love them as snacks, too !!",0
679,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!,0
681,Love this cheese. I use 2-3 of these containers per year. Refrigerate once opened and it will last till the expiration date.,0
683,"This is one of the best peanut butters I have ever tasted. A bare minimum of sugar and exactly the spice level I would have expected. To the person who gave it a one star, common, that is ridiculous. You should have atleast given three stars for innate quality and being a product that actually lives up to the label. OMG spicy peanut butter actually being spicy, who would have thought!",0
694,This waffle mix is so tasteless.  I'm shocked to hear this is the brand that is sold in some hotels. I would not recommend it to anybody.,0
698,I couldn't be happier! I was worried the expiration date would be a problem - nope! March of 2012. I was worried the milk would taste funny - nope! It's the best milk I've ever had!! Thanks for offering this at a great price!!,0
705,"These almonds make a good snack. The cocoa coating isn't sweet -- in fact, it's vaguely bitter -- and it isn't overpowering. The nuts themselves were good and fresh. My wife and I both liked them.  On the other hand, my daughter said ""I don't hate them, but I don't love them either."" Save these for the adults -- they'd work well with red wine or sweet cocktails.",0
707,It's really tasty and easy to cook. And it is less than 250 calorie. It's helpful to lose my weight.,0
710,"We made this and it was light, easy to make and great with chips and vegetables.  I purchased 20 for neighbors and friends for the hollidays",0
716,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.,0
719,"I dont know if I believe this tea is helpful for losing weight, but it tastes great and its a wonderful alternative to soda...which is the reason I bought it.",0
728,"I love peanut butter but occasionally have allergic reactions after eating it so, I avoid it when possible.  I first purchased ""SunButter"" after seeing it on QVC and BOY, was it wonderful!! I purchased it several times through QVC until they quit carrying it.  Fortunately I was able to purchase it again, through Amazon.  The pleasant, smooth, nutty flavor will keep me coming back for more!!!",0
743,"These are pretty good.  Some of the individually wrapped pieces must have tiny holes as some of the cookies are no longer crisp and fresh, but for the price, they are pretty great.  Most of them are good.",0
745,"I got a bag of this free at PAX 2009 and was really surprised how good it was. I mean, gamers generally don't eat well, but I like this better than most trail mix.",0
761,The Maple Almond Butter is incredible.  One of the best tasting foods I've ever had.  It is much better in the 1 oz pouches as you can simply eat it plain.  I started putting it on bagels and toast but the flavor of the butter gets masked by the food it is on.  My kids love it.  Easy to put in lunches.  Not to mention it is very healthy and organic.,0
764,"Mrs. May's Dry-Roasted Snack, Pumpkin Crunch, 2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)  Pumpkin Crunch is great. Stick with 2oz. size (2 servings) Much too easy to consume entire 5.5oz. bag without realizing it. :-D LOL",0
769,Amazon does it again.  I use these noodles in a chicken soup recipe and I always get plenty of compliments on it.  The gnocchi is perfect and packaged wonderfully.  Price can't be beat either.,0
775,"This stuff is great!!!!! I'm allergic to peanuts ( just happened over night ) and I miss having a PBJ, so this is the next best thing to it. :-) Truly, this butter is all that and then some....",0
789,These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.,0
829,"I remember well the ""Beer Nuts"" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'",0
842,"Great product at a great price.  Subscribe and save makes this an exceptional buy.  And oh yeah, my dogs love these too!",0
869,"I love Mrs. May's. These aren't my favorites of what they make, but they are tasty and handy to have around. The cashews or the black sesame seeds are the five star snacks!",0
872,"Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.  The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.  They are also great in a stir fry.  The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.",0
884,This was my first time ordering this product.  It was a great snack.  I love chocolate and this snack was a great alternative to chocolate candy from the vending machine.  They are easy to carry and if you don't finish all of it in one sitting the bar doesn't dry up since it's not made up of a bread.,0
887,"Chervil, the one spice I didn't realize was so darn hard to get. After searching up and down this infernal state in hopes of finding it somewhere in person I outstretched my arms to the infamous internet.  More specifically, Amazon!  I typed in the letters and wallah, I found items.  I decided to try this, as I have limited experience with Chervil, I'll admit it, and I am happy to report that it was safely in my hands exactly when I wanted it.  I opened it up to sample the herb, and from what I could tell it was also exactly as described. I'd recommend this herb for at least a taste of something different and considering the speed at which I got the item, I am extremely happy.  So till I experiment again, live long and eat well!",0
890,"I've been receiving this product via auto-delivery for about a year now.  I try to eat one of these bars as my lunch at least 3 days a week.  It tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber, protein, etc. to replace a meal.  I think it's a great way to help me lose weight.",0
894,"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it...",0
904,"I am not a rice connoisseur and the Roland Thai Jasmine Rice is the first type of Jasmine rice I have ever tasted. To me, this rice looks like Basmati rice (long and thin grains). It cooks pretty well (turns fluffy) and fast in the microwave. I add 2 cups of water for every cup of rice - and the cooked rice looks like cooked Basmati rice! The rice tastes good too although I have to say I prefer the taste of real Basmati Rice.  [...]",0
908,"I like these! They are crispy and flavorful. Also, they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others. Place a bowl of these on the table at your next BBQ and just wait for the compliments. Read the nutrition information and compare it to your favorite potato chips and ask yourself why you would want to ingest all that junk when these chips taste just as good.",0
916,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option.",0
918,"Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version.  Thse cookies do, though.  Melt in your mouth delicious, and just the right amount of lemon.  I am confident tht if you gave these to gluten eaters, they would not be able to tell the difference.",0
919,These are the best seeds I've ever tasted.  Full of flavor.  It's hard to stop eating them!!!,0
925,These chips have so much Chile lime flavor it's amazing. Baked wheat does not have as many calories as regular chips and not greasy at all. I live in Hawaii and the stores do not stock them here so i have to order from amazon... Thank God for Amazon.,0
928,IF YOUR A PORK RIND LOVER THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT FOR THOSE WONDERFUL TASTE BUDS. THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE THEY GO DOWN. MMM MMM GOOD.,0
932,What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers.,0
935,"This fruit and nut bar by KIND is very, very tasty.  Travels well, even in the heat.  No problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat.  Nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise, they are superb.",0
940,Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said.,0
944,"I bought this because of the pumpkin seeds and thought ""Oh, it's organic and 'hippy food', it's going to be awful"". However, it is amazing. Full of flavor and fruits and nuts, it is a hearty cereal that leaves you feeling good.",0
948,I make bread all the time & always look for variety...this bread is tasty & delicious! I have a two loaf bread machine and my husband kids favorite is this one!,0
953,"Had Demitris in a restaurant, and now it has become the go-to for tailgating and gatherings.  Easy to mix (and regulate the spiciness).  Only problem was that Amazon's packing when shipping caused one bottle to leak all over the box.",0
964,This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.,0
968,Pumpkin seeds are hard to find in the stores without an outrageous price. This is a great deal.,0
970,"I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!!",0
976,they are charging $1.00 per k-cup i saw this and decided to go to Keurig.com and these same k-cups are half price,0
980,"It taste good! But 30 bags seems too much for me, so ,,,,Share with your friends! Also suggest other flavor of Indomie noddles",0
986,"I take these for snacks & sometimes just for lunch . Very filling , can carry in your pocket with no mess.Love the flavor.",0
999,"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.  Not so...  They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.  I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt.""",0
1008,The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt.,0
1017,"I highly recommend these very tasty Kavli Thin Crispbreads. I wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all - it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh - and they keep forever in the cupboard. I definitely will be buying these for a long time. :)",0
1020,"Delicious, only it is not enough for one serving, rice are very tasty but gravy is not that great tast and also too much for the rice. If they can pack more rice and less gravy that will be very fine.",0
1022,"Post Honey Nut Shredded Wheat is a very nutritious and fulfilling cereal. My entire family loves it, exspecially my 7 year old daughter. We even enjoy eating them without milk, which serves as a great snack. I strongly recommend Post Honey Nut Shredded Wheat to families concerned about healthy eating.",0
1036,"I found microwave pork rinds quite by accident. But ever since, they are something I have wanted. Now I found them on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.  It's a quick, easily prepared snack, and as other reviewers have pointed out, not bad for your diet.  Once they come put of the microwave, open the bag, pour them out, and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl. I may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again",0
1038,"I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites.",0
1041,"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.",0
1042,"We saw this featured on the Travel Network a while ago, so when I saw it available through Amazon I ordered it for my wife for Christmas. Very tasy and very unique.",0
1043,"The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un-palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi-grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood.",0
1050,"I was surprised to finally see vegan baked goods on Amazon. I normally bake my own vegan baked goods but am always looking for products to try or send to my daughters in college. Because I do bake when I have time, I'm pretty picky and I have make pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, muffins, and carrot cake. Marge's  breads were outstanding! They were moist and not overly sweet. The icing on the carrot cake was delicious. They arrived in a couple of days as promised in a cute little basket which I'm using elsewhere now. I did freeze them as soon as they arrived and they held up beautifully. Since my order, I went directly to their website to order just the carrot cake. I wish Amazon would allow the option of only ordering three of the same breads. Thank you Marge's Bakery for making an outstanding product...thank you Amazon for finally carrying some vegan products--please continue to find these small businesses throughout our country!",0
1071,"This Chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting.  Actually a good, light and tasty lunch!",0
1072,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!",0
1078,"I was able to try these chips from a food show sample, and I fell in love.  They taste great!  Plus they are much healthier than the average chip.  Definitely recommend this product.  Let's get these in stores!",0
1081,"I was diagnosed with Celiac in May 2011.  There were few things I minded giving up but one was granola in my breakfast yogurt!  I found GF UDI's granola at a grocery store and it was $8 a bag, which is a lot when I eat it every morning!  So I was thrilled to find it at Amazon and at such a great price.  Worth ever penny - all flavors are great!  Vanilla is my favorite.  Thanks UDI's for making GF easy....",0
1084,"I'd never heard of these before, but I found a bag at my local liquidation store and decided to give 'em a try. They are among the best plain potato chips I've ever tasted. They have the perfect amount of salt, the perfect amount of curl and the perfect amount of crunch. They really do live up to their own hype.",0
1087,"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.",0
1094,It's a joke that they market this as basmati rice since it is not even vaguely similar taste-wise.  Texmati will surely disappoint Indian food lovers.,0
1097,"This is a great tasting product.  It can be used on more than just Mexican food. Tried it on hot dogs, and it was great. Not too spicy.  Give it a try.",0
1099,"This is a great product if you like a touch of ""hot"" on your pasta.  We first purchased it about 10 years ago when we were in Myrtle Beach.  It is hard to find where we live.  My husband will not eat his pasta withot this.  I also put a few shakes of it in my sauce when I am cooking it.  In this quantity it only flavors the sauce and does not make it hot to taste.  The biggest problem is that it is not often available.  I wish Amazon would stock it on a regulary basis.",0
1102,This has perfect balance of sweetness & nutrients. Its a great breakfast item. I love it. I will but it again from amazon.com,0
1105,I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.,0
1113,"My kids and I enjoy this served with warm pita bread for lunch. It is a little spicy to me, but my husband disagrees. It's quick, easy and tasty.",0
1117,"I agree with previous review - these don't resemble scallops in any way, but they are very good. I don't understand why they are so hard to find.  Recipe suggestion: cook ramen noodles, throw in a handful of chopped skallops when the noodles are almost cooked (just long enough to heat them up), drain most of the water then add the spice packet.  Not very classy but good and quick.",0
1124,after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?,0
1127,"My 14 month daughter loves these, she's been eating them since around 10 mos old.  Because 1/3 of the bag is a full fruit AND veggie serving, I sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time.  They're also great for snack time and it's good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit & veggie servings, when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available.  I also love that both flavors of these fruit & veggie melts are a completely mess free snack, which is always a plus. :)",0
1132,"I'm not smart enough to know enough about bottled water. I'm in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best.  Most bottled water strips the natural minerals out.  However, there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic.  A higher pH would be the opposite, so in that regard this should make this water much better.  Honestly I cannot tell the difference.  But I can say ther was no odor.  There was no bad aftertaste. But I cannot say if this is worth the price.",0
1145,"Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired",0
1151,"I was introduced to this product by my cousin. Quick and easy way to give some added flavor to your rice based meal. Many different ways to prepare, but my favorite is to marinate the meat in a slow cooker for the day, then add to my rice in the rice cooker. TASTY! Wife was a bit put off by the pink color at first, but the flavor pulled her past that. Looking forward to tryiong it in differnt ways.",0
1152,Amazon has the best price in town.  Hot nuts that don't disappoint.  I would recommend trying Dave's other items as well.  Great flavor.,0
1169,I love these.  They have a lot of flavor and no corn syrup.  Great product.,0
1170,"These chips are fantastic, they have just the right amount of spice and crispness.  These are probably my favorite chip on the market.",0
1175,"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.  Yuck!!!",0
1191,I love to have soup for lunch and as a result I like to have a variety of soups available.  This soup is very good.,0
1206,We found this pearl sugar after looking at a recipe in a King Arthur Flour Catalog.  It seems to be quite a bit cheaper then what you would pay at most specialty shops.  My wife uses it with Swedish Braided Bread.  Good stuff.,0
1210,"I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.  Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.  One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.  My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.",0
1212,This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you can't do it in a midrowave.,0
1232,"I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty.",0
1233,"Great product.  Easy to have on hand.  My 2 year old thinks it's fun to have a ""Milk Box"".",0
1237,This soup makes a great lunch or light supper.  It makes an easy and inexpensive lunch for work or school.,0
1255,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame.",0
1256,"These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!",0
1271,"I was a little hesitant in trying these Triple Nut Bars since I'm not a big fan of almonds, however, I haven't found all that many almonds in them.  Plenty of honey roasted peanuts and quite a large amount of broken up cashews, I love these!  I eat them slowly to savor the flavor, because they really are good.  These granola bars are a little larger in size than the standard, 4-1/2"" long by 1-1/14"" wide by 5/8"" thick.  Just salty enough to make them delicious, and sticky enough so it doesn't break apart when biting into one.  Yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating.  I will definitely buy these again.",0
1278,I can't believe how great this water is. I got the Apple Pear flavored water and am really into it. I put a couple into the freezer and get them super cold - and then take them with me for the day.  I also really love the way the bottle fits into a back pocket - let's me be hands free :-),0
1284,"I had high hopes for this product.  It was reviewed on the local morning news and I got the impression that it was a good, low-calorie substitute for ice cream.  In my opinion, it is not a good substitute at all.  It doesn't taste like peanut butter at all and barely tastes like chocolate.  My daughter tasted it and thought it tasted gross.  I wouldn't go that far but I will never buy it again - especially since it costs so much more than ice cream.  I'll probably take the suggestions of other reviewers and use it as a base for a shake. I have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor so I can't vouch for the other flavors.",0
1286,"I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few brazil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing.",0
1289,One of the best I've tasted!  Takes a bit longer to make but worth the effort!,0
1292,"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan.",0
1299,"I have been using this spice mix for many years but, I have found it hard to find lately. I decided I would check Amazon and I was very surprised to see it available! I am a fairly good cook and I have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty! A 12 pack is a lot of this spice but, it does keep for years and I use it quite often. Give your family the kick it deserves with ""Luzianne Cajun Seasoning""",0
1313,"Everyone in our family liked these chips.  Great taste and healthy compared to other chips.  If you like spicy food, you will enjoy these.",0

1319,"Over 11 years of gluten-free baking, this mix is the best chocolate cake mix that I've tried. I usually find other gluten-free cake mixes to be pretty dry. This one made very moist cupcakes with great chocolate flavor - I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between this and a cake made with wheat flour. And they were easy to frost - no stray crumbs sticking to the frosting spatula. I will definitely buy this one again.",0
1330,"These light, crunchy crackers are free of eggs, dairy/casein, wheat/gluten, soy, corn, nuts, peanuts, sesame, and coconut - an allergen free dream! And, YUMMY!",0

1351,"very healthy and low cal. why eat chips, this is salty and crispy. I also appriciate the great price from amazon.",0
1363,"I like this and will order again.  Just a little spice and sweetness.  The corn flakes are actually fried, so they remind me of a thin corn chip rather than breakfast cereal.",0

When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it's not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless there's an easy fix that i'm missing...",0

She also uses it to make yogurt and it works great at this also. So far the 'SS' price has been steady (not risen) for the past 4 or 5 months that we have been receiving it.  Thanks Amazon and thanks Mr. Bob.",0
1381,Perfect bachelor food - quick and easy.  Really tasty compared to top ramen noodles.  You can tell the seasoning is extremely sodium laden.,0
1382,I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.,0
1387,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on. Some chips have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more than just a ""hint"" of lime.",0
1400,"I went this way and that way for almost a month before ordering, and when I finally did order these chips, I wish I had ordered more!  I made the mistake of sharing with friends!

Nutritional value is not that bad compared to alternatives... but chips are chips, and these are worth it!",0

1429,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different. Will never buy these chips from here again.,0
1450,"I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves.",0
1462,"This mix is exactly as advertised . I Decided to add chopped onion ,sesame seeds and a small amount of Chile paste and  the results were outstanding . I also used .75 lbs of Ahi instead of the full LB. and it worked fine .I would buy this product again .",0

They are just as good as I remember: smoky sweet with just enough kick, and there's adequate seasoning on all of the chips. Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally. My only problem with these chips is their texture. They're a bit thin, and there's not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out.",0

1512,"The package doesn't lie: these are BIG bars! They are also very dense, and as a result are very filling. They're very chewy, so if you've got jaw problems you might wanna skip these. That's the only thing I didn't like about them. That being said, they have a great peanut flavor and I enjoyed the layer of peanut butter on the bottom. I think the peanut butter makes the bar. Overall, a very tasty snack and a nice, large bar.",0
1518,"I have very picky eaters in my house and this peanut butter is really great tasting and healthier too!

If you have not tried this product, please do yourself a favor and give it a try, I believe you will be extremely satisfied with the results. Our most difficult problem is waiting for the slow cooker to finish blending the flavors, but it is worth every minute we wait just thinking how darn good dinner is going to be.  Al Schweiger",0

1661,"Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.  Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch.",0

I basically took ATK's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats, raisins, chopped mac nuts, cinnamon and these chips. It would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if I would have ommitted these chips. Now as another reviewer said, the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash.",0
1720,I love this product! I have been taking wheatgrass for over a year and this is by far my favorite way to take it. Many of the other flavors are good too but this one mixes so easily with just milk. I also add this to protein shakes for a quick and easy way to get a helping of wheatgrass. I have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better.,0

Very pleased with the results..",0
1737,"I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.  Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!",0

Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left.",0
1763,I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.,0

1784,"Too salty. But that was not even the worst of the problems. It has a weird texture (I cooked it perfectly) and tastes horrible. If you haven't eaten pork rinds before, please stay away. Even the worst popcorn tastes better.",0
1788,"So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!",0
1793,"These are wrapped neatly in bundles with ties around each bundle so you can select the amount you need after opening each package.  Using boiling water with a small amount of oil these cook up rapidly.  It is necessary to cool these down with cold water after they've been drained to avoid sticking like most other noodles.  The noodles themselves are very tasty and make an authentic lo mein.  I recommend these and will order more when these are gone.  That may not be for a while, though as these are packed in a case of 30 packages.  Just be sure you don't overcook them.  It only takes about 2 minutes to boil them soft.",0
1811,"Those familiar with regular Oreos (and, really, who isn't?) won't find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter Oreo Fudge Cremes.  They consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme, then enrobed in a fudge coating.  The wafer is thin and nicely crispy.  The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that.  It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped.  The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness.  What else can really be said about an Oreo?  Although I might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense, I was still quite happy to nibble on them.  I certainly wouldn't mind doing so again.",0
1812,"Great taste and easy to make in very little time, great when adding raisins and whatever your likes and variations may be.",0
1826,"In the past I was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix. I made 2 rum cakes today thinking I had done something wrong when the first one didn't turn out as usual. I now realize I didn't do anything wrong,Duncan Hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product; I would gladly have paid more for the larger mix. Now I will never buy another Dunkin Hines Mix!!!!! How dumb do you think we are.",0
1827,"I have been using Shake `n Bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the Original Pork flavor.  This product is as easy to use as their other products: pour the Shake `n Bake into a sealable bag: put the pork chops individual, shake and then put them in the oven.  The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package.  The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it.  Much like the chicken version, the breading can fall off while cutting, but that is really the only negative I can say about the product.",0
1836,"I really wanted to like these, but I just found them to be to sweet/sugary. I generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason, and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound.  Sadly its just to sweet tasting for me.  Special note: The packs I received Oct 2010 have 20g sugar, not the 17g listed in the Amazon nutrition section. There may have been a recipe change . . .",0

Again, this was one of the best breads we have made here yet and will be ordering some very soon!!",0

1860,This bar was given out to serious mountain bikers during a recent race and I had a chance to sample one.  I found it delicious and because of it's raw live essence food content it is also a healthy snack alternative that is easy to carry with you.

1869,This white rice flour is fine instead of coarse like some.  Great for baked goods. My gluten free sugar cookies and shortbread cookies turn out excellent.,0
1870,"This was a gift and the recipient disliked the product.  Basically, a waste of money, as the 5 remaining cartons were never opened.",0
1877,"When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamela's and Bob's Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so don't waste your money.",0
1880,"Nearly perfect snack chip. Just a trifle too much salt and sugar keep them from getting 5 stars. The air pockets in the chips make them crisp but tender. The flavor is similar to kettlecorn, but thankfully not as sweet.",0
1886,"I needed these for my toddler granddaughter who has allergies to dairy, egg, and peanuts.  This product is free from all that worry.  The chips are small, love that, b/c I even use this in my cannoli filling and can pipe it out of a star-tip pastry bag w/o clogging up the works. They taste absolutely identical to any other chocolate chip, not 'off' tasting. In the health-food stores, this is about $5 a bag.  At this price I can bake with it and use more w/o worry of being a spendthrift. I made allergy-safe chocolate chip cookies with these yesterday and I had to stop myself from eating them all...a great product.",0

1899,"I am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out. The cakes are 18 calories, crunchy and good--not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes. Excellent as a base for PB&J, or to make an open face sandwich, or to use in pieces like a chip for dips, etc. Good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date.",0
1901,Not too much to say.  This worked perfectly in our little fondue fountain and tasted great.  Lots of good feedback from our friends.,0
1903,"This is a very good product and comes very close to ""fresh from the kitchen"" but breaking the clumps/adding the water to get the right consistency isn't as easy as one would think.",0
1906,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I have been using Crystal Light packets for most of this year. Ever since I tried one actually. I like the lemonade in Summer, but I like the iced tea year round, and it's actually my favorite. What I usually do is use a gatorade bottle (after it's been emptied or drank, of course) and fill it with ice from the ice maker, since those cubes fit, put the Crystal Light in add water and shake. Instead of buying water I just refill it from the tap and re-use the bottle. Great taste and easy to make.",0
1932,"I was pleasantly surprised at the new Crystal Light drink mixes.  The mojito flavor tastes a lot like the real thing.  There is a strong lime taste and sort of an after taste of a kick of mint.  This was my second favorite of the three varieties available, but it was pretty tasty and a nice change of pace.",0
1944,Great product for the price.  They stayed fresh for a while and tasted very good!  I love that we can get the cheddar blast in a large container.,0
1946,My son loves these pouches. It is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater. He loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch.  I love that it is organic and healthy. The fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children.  It is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out.  I highly recommend!,0
1951,"I like to munch a few nuts as a snack (in moderation, a lot better for one than eating potato chips). This is a nice taste treat.  There is a smoky taste to the almonds, which is to the good. On the down side, there is probably too much salt here (unfortunately), since salt produces health problems for people.  So, I wouldn't want to eat these tasty treats every day, but as a snack from time to time, these almonds really hit the spot.",0
1955,"I have been Gluten Free Since 2003 and this is I think the worst tasting GF mix I have come across. I have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about. I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldn't buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy, just dehydrated spuds. The only real good thing to speak of was the texture. It was light and moist but I would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor.",0
1972,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.  EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.  Very bad form amazon.",0
1976,"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.  That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing.",0
1989,All 3 flavors were very good often times with variety packs you end up with some good flavors and some not so good flavors but the whole family ate all 3 flavors up in no time.,0
1990,"I like these bars, but would rank them second to the Think Thin peanut butter variety.  Those are great.  These are very good.  Both offer up a good amount of protein for people who need more in their diet, such as vegetarians.",0
1997,I have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it! Just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is.  I buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.,0
2013,"This is an amazing biscuit! My all time favorite!  It's sweet, but not too sweet - that is the best part. Crunchy biscuits are grounded - and that is this product. I like to have it with milk, or with juice. It's very nutritious. Few spoons of ground plazma/lane biscuits, and a cup of milk make a very tasty breakfast. We make sure that we always have few boxes of this biscuits in the home - everyone enjoys it, grownups and kids.  To make delicious cake: add juice (orange or strawberry are my favorites) to lane biscuits, add little by little juice, so that you don't end up making it too liquidish; shape it as desired; add whip cream; and your cake is done!  Plazma and Lane biscuits from Bambi company are the same biscuit - same cookies, same company is making them; just name of cookies is different.",0
2020,"I need a filler and this was on sale at the moment for $6.5 for 6 it's worth it. Add water, chicken, potatoes, carrots, and mumble jumpbo. Result is good and tastety.  Individual package serve about 2 meals and it can not be save for long after opening, so plan carefully.",0
2022,"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets.",0
2055,"All of these fruit snacks are large and tasty. Muscat was a little gross, but all in all, a great product.",0
2063,This is truly a great versatile mix.  Substituting oil for butter and rice milk for regular milk works out perfect.  Using orange juice for the milk makes great pancakes and muffins as well.  The options are endless for muffins- our favorite is adding a bit of cinnamon and GFCF chocolate chips.  I also sneak in small amounts of light colored pureed veggies (baby food).,0
2082,"This is my favorite of the 3 or 4 blends offered by emerald. Can only seem to find it at Amazon, since the local grocers seem to sell out of it right away or do not carry it. Will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis.",0
2086,I like this product because it basically does what I anticipated. As long as you have a full glass of water with it it will keep you feeling full for a few hours.,0
2089,"This is the best nuocmam ever.  Smooth and extremely tasty.  Perfect on seafood, rice, whatever... Highly recommended - adds an amazing dimension to anything you use it on.",0
2091,I must say this product exceeded my expectation. I had the powder one before and it left a bitter after taste. I was very pleased with the liquid and have ordered on more in a different flavor.,0
2094,"This can be mixed with virtually any wine. I've had it mixed with champagne, Riesling, and Moscato, and it works well with them all. The price is rather steep, as I paid $7-$8 at a local gift shop.",0
2098,"I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)",0

I use peanut butter as a mid-day energy boosting snack -- straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it.  It's just THAT good to me.  I was more than happy with Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy.  I like the smooth texture it has, and it has a great mouth-feel that isn't the thick ""stick to the roof of my mouth"" kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat.  I don't feel that Skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product -- it tastes delicious and satisfying.  If you're a peanut butter lover like me, please look out for the fantastic prices Amazon has on Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy -- you won't regret buying it, and the reduced fat intake is a bonus!",0
2101,Like previous Crystal Light products this one is easy to use and mix and tastes great. Will plan on getting it again!,0
2111,We really enjoy De Boles Angel Hair pasta.  It isn't heavy and it is very tasty.  My kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta.,0
2122,"I boil rice and Quinoa together & after rinsing, will add about 1/4 cup of Go Raw Freeland Live Sprouted Seeds to it. The seeds naturally add flavor and a slight crunch to the rice and Quinoa. Nothing else needs to be added. All of the flavors mix together to provide a healthy and tasty meal.",0
2133,I really enjoyed this product.  It's very easy to mix and bake.  The taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread.,0
2145,"this isn't as easy as it looks, doesn't came with enough yellow frosting, and the frosting doesn't stick very well. My 5 year old did like making it though.",0
2147,These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.,0
2148,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""  Boo on Betty Crocker.",0

2168,"This snack tastes really good, I can't help myself eating it up.Although it's small in size, but I will difinitily purchase this again",0
2176,Nice alternative if you can't find them locally.  Great gift for the avid cook.,0
2184,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.  The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...  Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.  The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.  And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.  The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.  But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",0
2185,"These are vaguely like a Payday, nuts stuck together with chewy sweet goodness, and something vaguely like Rice Crispies in there. They are saltier than I expected, though I like that. I'm not seeing a lot of nuts besides the peanuts, though. And there is more of the cereal stuff than I was expecting.  I'm a big nut eater, so I do like these, and I like the salty sweet nutty sticky mess. But I think I'd prefer them w/o the cereal filler.",0
2205,"securely stores every precious ounce of breast milk. they are biodegradable, easy to use because they are large and stand up sturdily. i love these!",0
2211,Jelly Belly's have always been my secret vice. Now that I live out of the country I got this mammoth jar and it will last me more than a year. It came fresh and well sealed and right on time. Love the variety of flavors..yum.,0
2218,My 11 year old loves this product.  It is a nice little variety pack.  I am going to subscribe for 1 every 3 months.  Best hot chocolate k-cups made!,0
2219,"We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake. I believe they are WAY over-rated. Doesn't taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal ""cookie,"" like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre-teen.  In addition, cookies arrived cracked, broken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first.",0
2220,"Absolutely the best waffles and pancakes.  Follow the direction exactly.  My whole family agrees that this is a super product...the kind they have at most hotels/motels that offer breakfast,,,,,make your own at the breakfast.",0
2221,"I love this water.  It's liquid gold.  I bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of Trivedi Water as gifts to family and friends since then.  It makes a wonderful gift. Each person has had their unique experience with it.  I'm thrilled it's available on Amazon-now I can use it and share it more freely.  I've used Trivedi Water on plants with great success.  Most recently I started using it on my skin.  Wow.  It's clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way I couldn't have imagined. Truly amazing.  And in terms of drinking Trivedi Water--the taste is indescribable. The closest I could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream--fresh, clear, and vital with a quality of softness to it.  It quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying.  Try it.",0
2235,"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could.",0
2245,I like this almond flour very much.  It is a good price and tastes great.  I appreciate the texture of almond flour.,0
2269,"I don't have time for much shopping, and finding any sassafras drink is nearly impossible for me. Ordering this from Amazon saves me time and and gas money. It tastes good too. I mix it into a Mr. Beer bottle, then carbonate it with the Fizz-Giz Soda Maker. In this manor I am controlling what the sweetener is and how much I use. The sweetener that you use will make a big difference taste.",0
2270,These were excellent for the price. The gummies were soft and fresh and tasted great. I'm looking forward to purchasing them again in the near future.,0
2290,I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didn't enjoy.. I couldn't finish the bag!  My dog wouldn't eat them either ans she eats everything - including brusell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I don't remember the brand so I'll just have to do without,0
2297,I like this flavor a lot. When I make this I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of regular old fashioned oats. It makes it not quite so sweet and I like the texture of the non-instant oats. I just add water and cook in microwave for 3 minutes. I have no idea what someone said meant about the fake flavoring smell lingering for a week. I didn't have any problem with the smell.,0
2305,This dip is absolutely delicious.  It is so easy to make.  The price is also exceptional.,0
2306,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!,0
2323,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)  This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).  For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.",0
2326,This is a great mix. I mixed it with milk instead of water.  Just follow the directions.,0
2327,"This recipe is my favorite. I bought 5 boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season. Everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor. I did add some liquid smoke, some salt, and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches.  I make enough deer jerky to fill up (8) 1-gallon bags every season and this is by far the best I have tried to date",0
2337,I love the Peter Pan brand and I am pleased with the price.  Time to stock up so I did.,0

2355,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.",0
2356,"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!",0
2360,"I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?",0
2362,This is the first Redued-Fat Peanut Butter that I have thought was a good peanut butter.  I will buy it again when this is gone.,0
2363,I love these chips.  I no longer crave regular potato chips!!  They are so tasty and crunchy!! Alot of salt tho!!,0
2364,"This mix made tasty, crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron, but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price.",0

2396,"You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag..",0
2399,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.,0
2401,"I bought my mberry pack from mberry.us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth. I followed the directions to the letter, allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue. I then tried balsalmic vinegar - nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little. So I tried hot sauce - nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot. Then I tried regular vinegar - nothing happened again. I even tried taking a second tablet, but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue. HUGE waste of money. Super disappointing. DOES NOT WORK!",0
2405,This water taste great. We love the bottle. Perfect water for everyone :) I love that it is 1.5 liters because I am trying to drink more water. You will love this water.,0
2422,"FantasiCakes sent my cake FAST, and it was also sent MOIST!!  For me it's hard to go wrong with chocolate, but this cake really is fantastic! The icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure. I really liked that because I don't normally like a lot of icing. LOVE IT!",0
2424,Crust is a little bland but the middle is great! I wish it were in stock more often.,0
2430,"This was the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet, and as feared I was sent something other than what was pictured.

Not going to bother returning a $7 product, but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds.",0
2439,"When I opened the packaging I was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie I have had in a while. Not only did it taste great, the texture was perfect and it was fresh.",0
2447,These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!,0
2451,"I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.  There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.  Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.",0
2461,"The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non-DOP at any Walmart.

Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN!",0

2476,"I saw this product demonstrated on The Food Channel and knew I had to order it as I LOVE pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting.  Follow CAREFULLY the directions with these for a spicy, fresh and tasty snack every time. YUM!!",0

2496,"These crackers are a great treat for those who are gluten intolerant as well as those who may be looking for a potato chip substitute.  These rice crackers have good flavor, good crunch and just enough salt.",0
2501,"This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.  This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.  Much as I like this, since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that I eat, and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion, for now I will stick with my granola bars. But if portion control is not a concern, then this is a great snack.",0
2502,I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!,0

2577,"This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing.",0

2609,"First of all, I'm a cashew lover, so I figured I'd like these nuts. What I didn't expect was how much I'd like the sea-salt pepper combo. There's a slight 'twang' after eating a handful of these, and they are great with a cold beer or soda. Each nut is big and bold, no little pieces in this jar. The packaging is great; good for taking along on trips. The twist lid is easy on and off. If you enjoy spice, go for these, the pepper does give a little extra kick.",0
2619,"I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.",0
2626,"Can as be used to make cookies - even egg free!  I just used the mix, enough apple sauce to make a batter, some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked.  turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven.  However, even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here.",0
2637,I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.,0

2658,"this wasn't quite what I expected - the last time I ordered a similar treat, it was thinner crispy banana slices - these are thicker bananas.  my dog loves them, but there is so much banana that I can't give her more than one or two a week - too rich - they give her the runs.  but she loves them!",0
2660,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on.

I wish that these chips had more that just a ""hint"" of lime.",0

2673,"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great.",0
2674,Knowing that I like ramen my sister suggested that I give these a try. I'm on my second order as I really enjoy the flavor and texture. The noddle's in this Yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what I am use to in the ramen packets that I normally eat but are very tasty. As with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used.   I reason for only 4 stars has to do with the container that is used. After it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip. Not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container.,0
2680,"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!  You can freeze these with no loss of quality.  Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold.",0
2681,Great taste and easy to carry with you for whenever you may want flavored water. The taste is not overpowering or too bland. I prefer this to just plain water.,0

2705,"I love chocolate shakes and malts and I'm playing around with ingredients to achieve flavor with fewer calories. I bought some Carnation Malted Milk to add to the mix and make a malt. Unfortunately, this stuff had no malt flavor that I could detect and it made the result undrinkable. I'm throwing away the rest of the bottle.",0
2706,MIO Liquid Peach Tea has a great taste.  The bottles are small so you can toss one in a backpack or purse and take it with you to add to your bottled water.  It is easy to add too much to your water so start slow and taste first before adding more.  I would really recommend this.,0
2721,"I like corn and come from the northeast, where fresh, local corn is a common spring/summer side item, so I'd like to think I know from corn.  I tried a can of Glory's corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty.  Good stuff!",0
2725,"This is a wonderful tasting turkey broth that is so convenient. It is very shelf stable so it's handy to keep around, the packaging takes up little room in a small kitchen. It will be great in stuffing and gravy and will save me the time of always having to make stock before having turkey, which I always do. As soon as it arrived I put a cup of water into the microwave to boil and then added the contents of the little packet to the water, the taste was more than I expected from a convenience product. With the addition of some fresh herbs, turkey drippings and flour, you'll be having everyone at the table thinking you're a gourmet chef! I'll be adding a few packs to the stock I make from the turkey carcass this year, it will only help intensify that great turkey flavor. I'll order this again in the future but for right now the amount I have on hand should last quite a while.",0
2731,Having a peanut allergic son this stuff makes a great substitute.  texture wise it is exactly like peanut butter but with a slight cinnamon after taste quite pleasant.  I found it in walmart for under $4 a jar so I would suggest shopping around some. I bought the creamy version but a crunchy version was also available..also much more cost friendly then the peanut-free almond butter that was to be found for like $9/jar,0
2740,These are even tastier than the original flavor! Works great in belgian waffle maker too! Why are they not priced right and available by subscription???,0
2745,"In court, as I understand it, you're not supposed to testify about anything where you don't have direct experience.  You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.  I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving).  She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, ""The worst thing I've ever tasted"".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.  While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, I'm inclinded to think it's not very good.",0
2746,"These bars are pretty tasty. As you might imagine, they are truly for ""nut lovers."" Fairly sweet with great nutty flavor. It's nice that they don't just use peanuts.",0
2755,"These granola bars are quite delicious. Out of the three bars that Kashi makes, these are my second favorite (next to the Trail Mix ones). These make a good snack.",0
2759,Somehow I thought for the price - I was getting a case - not one little bag.  Should have ordered the case I found elsewhere.,0
2761,"I found this stuff to be very tasty, great with jasmine rice or just as a snack. I don't mind a little MSG if it enhances the flavor.",0

2790,"Purchasing the Glace De Volaille Gourmet Gold Roasted Turkey Stock from Amazom. I used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions, carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine. It did not inspire me.  The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine, brown onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.  The Glace De Volaille Gold Roasted Old World Gravy recipe, well it went into the trash.",0
2791,I have tried three brands of almond butter so far and find Barney Butter has the best flavor.  Another had fewer ingredients and lower fat but I like BB best.,0
2803,I purchased this based on the hugely positive reviews and for the promise of having a tasty alternative to regular peanut butter.  I was amazed at how good it was!  Definitely buying this again.,0
2809,"Tastes like good, odorless, fresh, clean water. I like the fact the water is electrolyte infused.  The bottle is a very generous size, but easy to grip and hold.",0
2819,"My wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. However, this gravy is fantastic, idiot proof (even I can make it) and reminds me of my grandma's cooking. My wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard.",0
2825,The nuts used tasted very fresh. The bite sized chunks were just right. It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. Very satisfying = ),0
2829,"It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again.",0
2835,"This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!  These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)  Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.  Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)  Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola ""thins""  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).  Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)  [...]  Exclusively",0
2871,"Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didn't love me.  I haven't had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick.",0
2877,"This is a great cornbread mix!  I don't eat gluten products & it can be difficult to find good non-gluten muffin mixes.  This is so yummy, especially when you add honey (a variation of the recipe written on the package).  I eat it all of the time! : )",0
2885,I agree that this is agreat product.But I got it at King Arthur flour co.for $5.99 per pound.,0
2890,I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.  I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.  Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.,0
2898,"I really love this stuff and I will be buying more for sure. One bottle lasts a really long time, too. It is better than any of the diet fruit punches I have tried so far. I really can't recommend this enough. 5/5 stars.",0
2900,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!",0
2903,"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!",0
2915,"This is the second brand I've tried. I was surprised that it smelled different. It tastes great and works just the same as the other more expensive brand. I will be ordering more! If you haven't ever tried using it as a moisturizer...try it! My skin can be oily in the summer, but this is not heavy or greasy even in the summer. And it works better than ANYTHING I have tried for winter dry/chapped skin! Tastes great in everything from stir-fry to cinnamon rolls too.",0
2918,"Quick and easy to prepare. This is one of the few whole wheat pastas I've found that has a great taste. I use orzo in place of rice in recipes, as well as in soups, etc.",0
2926,Bought them for myself..eldest daughter fell in love :) enjoys them SO much. Spicey but only a touch..second eldest daughter enjoys them so much i share a bag of them often,0
2927,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring.",0
2928,"They crumble easily and I can use water from my coffee pot (minus the coffee of course) and the variety of flavors it a win!  Sure the calories are a bit high, but you can work that off in no time.  The Good:  Quick, easy and flavorful  The Bad:  The calories  Overall:  I will keep buying them while deployed",0
2930,"This is the second time I have ordered this product. The first time I thought it was very good. This time,however, it tastes as though it has been watered down. The consistency is thinner and the taste is weaker. I will not purchase this again.",0
2937,What I enjoy most with this variety pack is the 11 varieties. I don't get bored with just 1 flavour and there are some flavors I cannot find locally.,0
2963,Great taste and easy to use. I did find that if you let the package soak in hot water for a few minutes before use it makes the oil come out of the package easier.,0
2964,"I have tried many flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and until I tried this one, I liked them all.  The ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added..........but it's more than a touch. Unless you really, really love carrot cake, you might want to make a different flavor selection. My favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal.....I wish I could get it all year long. The oatmeal raisin is my second favorite. I wish I had ordered them instead of these morning glory.",0
2969,This almond butter tastes very good and it has a pleasing creamy texture.  I will buy more even though it is expensive.  It is worth it on my restricted diet because of the convenience and the good taste.,0
2970,"It's a tub of mixed nuts, I'll spare you a long-winded review on them. I've tried the mixed nuts they sell locally, which have a lot of peanuts mixed in, and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable. These are much firmer, fresher, and just taste overall better. It seems the filler nut they used here were almonds, which is fine, and certainly better then peanuts, but it's unfortunate that pecans are scarce. Brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well, with moderate amounts of hazelnut (Filbert) and cashew. You get a lot of salt near the bottom, naturally, but otherwise there's just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack. Much better than the rest I've tried so far.",0
2971,"Tasty, spicy, and good. Became quite the conversation piece at work. No one have ever  heard of microwave pork rinds before. They tasted them and love them. Only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook.",0
2972,"Great value, just be sure to have a place where the bag won't be crowded. Or transfer into a hard container and scoop out desired amount when needed.  Corn flakes taste hearty, (you can actually taste the corn), nice thick flakes that don't go limp a minute after being exposed to the milk.",0
2978,"I bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out.  The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Don't waste your money.",0
2985,This PB tastes good and is goood for you! It makes good sandwiches. I only wish it were in stock more often!,0

3001,These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.,0
3007,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.",0
3031,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market.",0
3033,"This is my favorite flavor of microwave popcorn.  You don't get that creepy fake butter taste.  It tastes like the kind my dad made on the stove when I was a kid, with oil and salt.",0
3043,"These are a tasty treat but I would not eat one everyday. I like all nuts in bar - honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews. I like them separately but having them together blended really nicely, I was surprised!  I was very impressed with the size of the bar. Compared to other bars they are a generous size. I think I will be buying them in the near future. Great taste and fair size.  Update: March 2012, I liked these so much I bought more. They are not healthy for you but are very tasty. I try to eat one every few days.",0
3044,"I bought this because I thought it was the same as white sweet potato flour. I was disappointed but then after I baked cookies w/ it, they were actually good. Gluten-free, egg-free, dairy-free.  Will taste great though if you added eggs.  I thought I'd share my recipe  1 cup sweet potato flour 1/4 cup canola oil(or safflower) 1/8 cup honey 1/4 cup water (or any other non-dairy milk substitute) a dash of salt 1/2 TB baking powder  Optional: chocolate chip cookies, shredded coconut and or almond pieces or any other nuts.  Mix everything and roll into small balls. Flatten on cookie sheet covered with baking sheet. Bake for 10-14 minutes or til firm. They burn easily so watch.",0
3047,"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options.",0
3061,I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.,0
3067,"I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a ""good"" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have ""Masa corn flour"" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.",0
3069,This granola has a great taste and texture.  It is one of my favorite desserts.  All the Bakery on Main granolas have wonderful flavor.,0
3072,"I used this in cakes, cup cakes and candies, its great in drinks i found as well as long as your making mixed drinks. I really enjoyed this produce and i urge people to try this and experiment with it, be adventurous with your cooking and the flavors you use its truly worth it!",0
3081,"A great product at a great price.  These little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores.  Not sure why, but they do.  Others have written the same thing.  Very convenient box and easy to store.  Makes a great adder for school lunches and etc, or just a quick snack on the run.",0
3082,"I love granola and sometime add rasins or nuts but this stuff was good just as is, in a bowl with milk or right from the bag.",0
3093,"the first moment you bite into this cracker, you will notice the difference.  This tasty, crunchy, organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad.

3108,"Tried the fruit punch in a glass of water. A little goes a long way and tastes great! Turn bottled water or tap water into a great tasting beverage: refreshing, no cal and healthy",0
3119,"This is one of the best tasting waters that I've tried. It is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it. It is enhanced with minerals and honestly, I can taste the mineral taste which I like. Funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume. Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.  I really liked it and gave it to my family too. They were surprised with a yum which isn't really a reaction that I normally get from water.  It has 9.5 pH factor and infused with electrolytes. Can't really tell those things from drinking it but good to know. Recommending completely on taste. It's excellent tasting water.",0
3121,These almonds deliver the crunch of freshness that I love in nuts! Some nuts you can tell are old because of their softness but these almonds are incredible and tasty! Great for a quick pick me up!,0
3123,"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.",0
3124,These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.,0
3135,"Very good. Tastes like Original Jack Links only with a little more flavor. Very tender and not dry, but a little on the salty side. The bag is HUGE though and there is a tiny amount in the bag! It's disappointing.",0
3136,"This offers a quick way for a tasty drink. Fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola - peach tea! Yeah, not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good. They say 24 uses but I probably got only 15 or so since I either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses.  The current price on Amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle. I think that is pretty steep but I would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors.",0
3158,I can't go back to any other mashed potatoes after eating these!  I would honestly prefer these over real mashed potatoes.  They are so creamy and just seems to have a nice balance of everything that comes together to make a great texture and taste!  Had these for Thanksgiving dinner and several people wanted to know my recipe for the mashed potatoes. Ha!  Honest Earth can't be beat!,0
3160,"I purchase Banh Trang Spring Rolls Skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls, but recently I got a container with black spots mixed into the skin.  I tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didn't work and had to be thrown away.  At the bottom of the container, 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin.  At that point, I decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until I purchased a fresh batch of a different brand..  When trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly, I was unable locate their company webpage, although there were many references to the Co. name Bahn Trang.",0
3161,This fondant was very smooth and easy to work with along with having a good taste.  You don't always get good taste in fondant.,0
3166,"These chips make a wonderful snack.  They give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times, without a lot of calories.  They also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time.  They came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control.  I would order them again.",0
3182,"The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate. I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix.",0

3186,"I'm a newbie when it comes to homemade waffles. I purchased a belgian waffle maker through Amazon and was looking for a good recipe for the waffles. When reading the reviews of the waffle maker, so many mentioned this waffle mix that I figured I would give it a try instead of making my own. I'm so glad I did! I used the tip of adding milk instead of water and followed the rest of the directions exactly. From start to finish this morning, I was enjoying fresh waffles in 5 minutes. The taste was restaurant quality and it was easier than I imagined.",0
3200,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money.",0

3209,"I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-don't buy it unless you want really dry bread.",0
3226,"As other reviewers have noted already, this seems to be Kellogg's attempt to replicate Honey Nut Cheerios, at least in appearance.  Nutritionally the two are also very similar.  Crunchy Nut tastes sweeter and I found myself eating it as a snack.  I can't say the taste is too similar to HNC so just because you like one doesn't mean you'll necessarily like the other.  Overall it's definitely to my liking and I can see myself buying both Crunchy Nut and HNC.",0
3238,"I bought these noodles at an overstock store once, and had I known at the time how good they were going to be I would have stocked up. As it stands, unless you live near an asian market or similar store you'll have a difficult time getting these locally. Fortunately, Amazon provides. All of the varieties are very good, this one brings out the savory flavor of the mushrooms and the texture of the bean thread noodles is satisfying. It prepares quick and easy, and only requires boiling water like a typical self contained ramen bowl. Great for work, and quite filling for the size and price.",0
3241,"This is a great 100 calorie snack, with great taste and texture.  Amazon delivered a fresh product with an expiration date a year out.  To the guy who said there are only 4 cookies in a bag, that is crazy.  It is more like 20 cookies per bag, maybe more - I didn't count them, but I wasn't disappointed by it at all.",0
3255,"I really like this popcorn and go through it so fast, although Orville Redibacker's smartpop version is better. If you're looking for the tradional kettle corn however, don't order it. It's not as sweet and does not have all that oil that makes the true kettle corn flavor so it may not be what you're looking for.",0
3268,"These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money.",0

3300,"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.  It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.  While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.  I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it.",0
3301,"This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.  It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.  The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot.",0
3307,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.",0
3309,When ever possible I try to buy the Duncan Hines angel food cake mix as it's the best tasting box cake mix on the grocery shelf. Some of the other angel food cake mixes may have a slightly funky after taste. The Duncan Hines brand does not.  The cake mix is easy to prepare and bakes up tall and light.  Highly recommend.  Note:  I like the two-step version of this cake mix but it's no longer made. :-(,0

IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over-bearing and the spice was pretty intense.  I don't think I'll get it again...I guess it's good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.  I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce.",0

Some people who don't like Mayo have told me they like this.",0

3436,"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this.",0
3440,"I have only praise for this product.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 for it does not come with a bag.  It is called SHAKE N BAKE but there is no bag to shake it in!  Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.  I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.  Very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork.",0

3484,These don't even taste like cashews.  They are fresh and crunchy enough but you would never know they are supposed to be cashews.  I don't know anything about roasting cashews but I think it's funny that every other brand seems similar in taste and Emerald does not.  It's not that they have an off-flavor.  They have no flavor.,0

The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes.",0

But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12.",0

They will stick together - so when you take them out of the water and put them on paper towels, make sure that you lay them out - otherwise, you will have issues later.  They do NOT have a taste, so make sure that you stir fry them or let them simmer with whatever you are using them with, otherwise, you will be disappointed.

3598,"I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I've had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar-free Kool-Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.  Luckily I found the taste to be really good.  Even my picky kids love it!  I love the fact that these come pre-sweetened in individual pouches.  You just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water.  It couldn't be faster or easier!  It even dissolves well in cold water.  I just ordered a case of the cherry flavor, too.  My kids and I can't get enough of the tropical punch flavor, so we're excited to try cherry, too.",0
3599,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.  300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.  I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.  The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.  Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)  I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.  UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything.",0

3605,"I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.  I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds, and they arrived in less than 48 hours. Four sealed bags were also in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box.  I just opened one bag of the seeds to try them. They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk. These seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off-taste. These have a slight pumpkin taste, which they should have. This variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties I've had, which I like (no pointy ends to stab me as I'm munching them down). All in all, a great buy!  Seeds = 5 stars Grown in the USA = 5 stars Total = 10 stars!",0

3669,"We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.  It does call for an odd amount of eggs, that would be the only complaint.",0

3681,"The seeds are really good, but this new flavor is a big time MISS.  The taste is just terrible.  I bought a whole case, I don't know if I will eat em.  I have to put a bunch in my mouth, then put in some water, rinse the flavors off in my mouth and spit all the liquid out, just to eat the seeds.  I don't know what they were thinking on this flavor.  It is rather indescribable.  They should've made a spicy BBQ or cajun instead.",0
3687,"I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.  Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.  It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)",0
3706,"I really like Virginia Diner unsalted peanuts, so I decided to give this flavor a try.  The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.  If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).  Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.  This type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy, and they were.  The nuts are small, and mostly in halves.  There are a few fragments, but not many.",0

3727,I like Bob's Red Mill flours and the sorghum flour is great too. The pack of 4 is a great price (at least where I live) and it works well in creating the recipes from my gluten free cookbook.,0
3728,"Pros: No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving) No added salt (30 mg per serving) Great taste Organic No stirring needed  Cons: Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping) Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter') A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving)  This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety.  It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.  Amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems (USPS).",0
3737,These chips are great tasting!  You have to try them if you like sweet potatoes.,0
3750,"When I read the reviews, I noticed someone mentioned the box was light.  It is, but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.  As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.  I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip.  The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt.",0

3910,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.",0

3932,"I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.  Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1"" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.  These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.",0

After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds.",0
3938,"I picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles. The cake was heavenly. I liked it so much, I found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing, and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which I bought but haven't tried yet.  The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.  I simply loved it. Hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor.",0
3956,We're so happy we tried this.  If you love Red Lobster Biscuits these are the ticket.  I highly recommend this product. Wow... what a find! Yummy,0
3965,"Love this bag! Perfect size. I've been using it to make a 1/2 gallon of fresh almond milk every 2-3 days for the last 6 weeks and it works great. Super-fine mesh makes a super-smooth milk, and it rinses clean in a snap. The seams are very well sewn (unlike others I've seen, where the thread is already unraveling) so I expect it will hold up for a good long time. I bought 2 more to give to my mother and my sister.",0
3967,Having usually eating store baught peanuts I'd have to say the taste was much to my supprise..  Very fresh and tasty.  Their about 1 1/2 times bigger than regular peanuts..  I'm glad I got them with the skins they were very tasty.. The salt just right.,0
3981,"I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love.",0
3987,These are a cheap fake. Nothing like the real Emerald nuts you buy in the store. Its a complete waste of money. DONT get ripped off like I did.,0
3993,Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram,0
4000,"I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried.",0
4004,"I have been using Walden Farms products since the company came to North America and they are a regular part of my shopping list. Their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic. This is so versatile and great on Salmon (maple glazed), chicken, turkey etc, in chili and stews instead of molasses, great in butternut/carrot/pumpkin pureed soups, in milkshakes, on toast (french toast, biscuits, bread puddings, or breakfast bakes, on eggs, pancakes, high-fiber cereal, in puddings, hot and cold cereals, desserts, ice cream souffles,and in steamed milk and hot coffee! This is great on waffles, or to bake with (great for cakes/muffins etc); I love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in. I especially love mixing it into Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl, but healthy. Great way to have flavor without the added sugar.",0
4007,"I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.  I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD.",0
4016,Lipton Raspberry Instant Mix is so easy to make just put a few spoons of the product in a glass of water and add ice---it has such a light fruity taste that you feel good every time you take a drink--try it when you come in the house after a hot time in the garden---sooo good,0
4029,"Eat it by the handful, mix with baking  or other food, or mix with bee pollen for ultimate nutrition.",0
4038,"Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie.  In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense.",0
4039,"I really liked these chips.  They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.  The cheddar, bbq, and salt/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.  The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.  Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos.",0
4043,These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.,0
4049,I've tried tons of GF pancake mixes.  I could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again.  These are so moist and delicious.  My 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease.  She loves them too.  My wife and children who are not GF also love them. m,0
4050,"I love these.  They really taste like a soft PB&J sandwich, and you can bring them anywhere!  Kids would love them too.  I hope they're available again soon because I'm running low!",0
4057,"THIS WAS BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.  THE VARIETY WAS A GREAT BLEND OF DIFFERENT SOUPS AND SO EASY TO FIX.  EVEN MY HUSBAND LIKED THEM.  I QUICKLY ORDERED ANOTHER SET, BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD.  TASTY AND EASY",0
4060,"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!",0
4061,"Easy food. Open can, drain water from can, take product out, fill with steamed rice. It makes a great, easy lunch. I'm a big fan. I've just got to figure out how to get them out of the can without tearing the packets...",0
4062,These work great in reducing nausea for my pregnant wife. Much better than preggie pops. These also taste good. I would buy again.,0
4068,I made the waffles and was not impressed. Definitely not worth the expense!  It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops. I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.,0
4075,"In Christmas, 2010 I first ordered Clayton Fruit Cakes. They where great! Nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts. These were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a Fruit cake really great. So I re-ordered in Christmas of 2011. What a disappointment! I ordered 5 one pound cakes. When my order arrived, I was so excited. Yes I like fruit cake. Only too be very disappointed. Not only where the cakes void of very much fruit, unless you want too count the raisons as fruit. I will not be ordering Clayton Fruit Cakes next year. I can get the same results from a Hostess Fruit cake, and only spend $3.50, instead of close to 30 dollars for the Clayton cakes.",0
4077,Item was perfect.  They have a very good sweet cinnamon taste and they were not too hot (I do not like spicy food) for me.  I received them quickly and would re-order again.  These are my favorite candies and it is very hard to locate in stores now.,0
4082,"These biscuits are very good and my second favorite to the blueberry. These biscuits are not filling enough alone for breakfast so I eat them as a sweet snack. I wish the calories were lower, but that doesn't deter me from buying.  They are a winner.",0
4085,I like to put wild rice in many dishes. This is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups.,0
4086,"My whole family loves this stuff... tastes great and has a great texture also.  The granola has a ""puffed"" texture so it's not as hard as some other granolas.  The pumpkin seeds give it a great flavor and it's good both with cold milk or warmed as a hot cereal.",0
4087,"The packaging isn't too sophisticated, and (as another review mentioned) it's more liquid than other kinds of tahini, but it really tastes great.  This how I've used it: A Goya package of dry chickpeas - dipped in water for 24 hours, then boiled for 3 hours About 8 ounce Tahini Half a cup water Lemon juice Salt Garlic Blend everything until smooth",0
4088,"Right. I know what you're going to say: it's granola.  How exciting can granola be?  This stuff is delicious. Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.  If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!",0
4094,Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.  Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.  Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.,0

4110,"Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds.",0

I love the caramel ones the best!",0

4187,"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.",0
4192,"I love this item, the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor, rather than eating plain pork.  A butcher recommends this to his customers.  A nice break from steak, chicken and fish.",0

4227,"For me some bottle water is better than others. This bottled water was very good. It had a good, clean taste which is always important, especially for those who do not enjoy drinking water. The bottle was also thick enough to withstand being dropped but not so thick that you are really just paying for the bottle. Overall I would buy this bottled water again.",0
4231,"All the Wylers singles to go are great!  They taste good and mix easily in bottled water.  Most places are overcharging for this item.  Walgreen's sells a package of 8 for $1.00 (or less; It was $0.59 a package of 8 over memorial day).  Most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating $1.00 per box.  I see some places charging over $2 per box.  At that rate, you can buy a 12 ounce can of soda (even big brands when they are on special,) and you get the can and the water included! So why spend that much just for the powder?",0
4243,"I don't like cinnamon and I don't like apples, so I was surprised when a friend offered me  Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  and I liked it. I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.  I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh.",0
4246,These rum cakes taste really great!  I get them for myself and also get them as gifts.  Last year I bought one for everyone on my team at work. They absolutety loved them and talked about how soft and moist they are?  I am glad I know where to find them as I buy them all the time.,0

They do really stick to your teeth a lot, but it's as sweet as candy (even without added sugar) so I wouldn't consider that a huge detriment.

4267,"Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.  I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor).",0
4274,Great. Love these and happy that can be found on line. would love if you carry the snak size bags because i open a bag i tend to eat all; and the snak bags are better for portion control.,0
4277,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.",0

I love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home. These work well and taste great.  The only issue I have is that they really aren't the healthy option I thought.  They contain oil and sugar, bringing the calorie content to 375 per bag.  It is better to eat an apple, but these are a mighty tasty snack.",0

My first batch was 14 (there were 26 wraps in the package) and I thought I'd bake some spring rolls.  I think I had splits in about half of them.  My 2nd batch went a little better, with only about 1/3 with tears.  I know I can perfect this with time and patience, and these are a really good price, so I won't feel bad about playing with my food!  :)",0
