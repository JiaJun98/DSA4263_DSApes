3007,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it."
829,"I remember well the ""Beer Nuts"" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"
577,I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.
3300,"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.  It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.  While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.  I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it."
