2693,"I found this Fajita sauce and the related Chimichurri sauce at a local Global Foods mart, but after using the bottles up, my wife recycled them and I had forgotten the brand name.  So I spent the next 6 months looking for them ever time we went grocery shopping - apparently the local mart stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I bought lots of Chimichurri sauce brands - most of which were not nearly as delicious as I recalled this brand to be - until on a whim I looked up ""chimichurri"" here on Amazon.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the World Harbors label, I recognized the brand again! :-)  Anyway, whenever I make burritos or tacos, I add either the chimichurri or fajita sauce and my family & guests now think I should go into the restaurant business! :-P"
114,"I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!  Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended."
1841,OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.
