7,"I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.  I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it",3

12,"My vet recommended these for my half-Siamese, very particular, cat because she kept having tarter buildup (and, as a result, bad breath). I was skeptical because my cat is VERY picky about food. She LOVES them. It is her ""treat"" each day. Well, my vet stopped carrying them, so I came to Amazon and now I never have to worry about quick delivery, tarter buildup, bad breath or an unhappy kitty! Life is great with CET Enzematic cat chews!",3

39,"These were freakin awesome. All 10 LBs were top quality, and better than many restaurants.  Ordering my second batch now.  How I prepare them: place several legs in a pot of boiling water for about a minute, or less if you stir em.  They are already cooked so you just want to heat them up. Cooking them further will ruin them. The end piece will piece will take a bit longer.",3
42,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.  The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!  I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!",3
50,"My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854). to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations.",3
63,My dog LOVES these treats! The ingredients are so good for her and they don't cause any allergies or reactions either. Great product!,3

99,"Having worked in a movie theater in high school and through college, popcorn is a very nice treat.  That was 40 years ago, and it is still a very nice treat.

104,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.  I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.  Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!  Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)  Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.",3

134,Do you want people to think you ran out to the theater to buy popcorn? This product is great and has that theater taste.,3
140,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.  Delivery was unexpectedly fast.  The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.  This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}.

193,"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)",3
210,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)  Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""  Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.  Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.  So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:    * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)   * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces   * a combination of the above two factors   * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract   o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease   o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation   o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage  Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.  Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.  Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.  When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.    The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.  The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top  Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.  The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.  The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top  Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:    * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.   * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).    Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:    Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""    ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""    For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.    * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.   * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.   * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)   * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)  Top  Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:    * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.    The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.    * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.  Top",3

358,"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.",3
362,"My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.

I'm also excited to pack them when we go on picnics. =) My 2-year-old, and my 10-month-old are able to slurp these up in just seconds, but they enjoy each and every second of it.  I am curious though, if anyone knows.... Are these pouches BPA free? Everything else about them is so good, that I would hope they would be, but it doesn't say it anywhere on them. =( So, my assumption would be that they are not BPA free, otherwise that would be a high marketing point.",3
443,"I bought this from my local health food store, It has a wonderful coconut taste. I use it in everything from my morning oatmeal  to yogurt. I put some in my dogs food and their coats have been so shiny and soft. I also suffer from a dry flakey scalp so i massage a small amount into my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes before i shampoo it out, it leaves my hair so soft and shiny. it is a great waterproof mascara remover too. I will be buying this item in bulk! I love all the benefits coconut oil has to offer.",3
445,"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.",3
474,I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.,3

I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness.",3

505,"If you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast, not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant, but the kind that hunters grab when they are together, thick, with lots of fat in the middle, you WILL enjoy these! You can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them.  Now I must admit I am a wimpy, crispy kind of gal, and I like my bacon on the lean side, in fact with my allergies I have to use Morningstar Soy bacon (don't cringe!). So when I bit into these, I realized from the very first bite I was NOT their intended audience.  Nope, these are not ""girl food."" They are man food. If you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning, this is the perfect selection for you. However, you might want to consider the  David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix  for a selection, or the milder and tamer  David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler . Both will give you a variety to try, just in case you don't like bacon as much as you think you do.  I am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try, and am basing my review on the samples which they sent. (Oh, I passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies).",3

532,"Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.  Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!",3

556,"My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.  Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.  I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.",3

Many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but can't digest seeds (folks with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, for example). They can, however, enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product. I but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house! It tastes best (in my humble opinion) on toast.  It is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products, but I stir it up as soon as I open a jar, then refrigerate it. The oil doesn't separate again (although I do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast).  Highly recommended.",3

652,Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.,3

771,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.  I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.  My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.  I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.  For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.  We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.  A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.  So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.  I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.  Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",3

840,We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,3

853,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",3

Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty.",3

He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.  Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande.",3
931,"I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky. One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!  We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick. I'll never buy anything from Earth's Best again!",3
946,A friend got the Everlasting Treat ball and 2 extra refills for my 17lb. dog.  My dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within 20 min. It makes me mad when I think of how much it and the replacement treats cost and now it is trash.  That is why I am writing this review.,3
952,The basis of my diet is using the Zesty Italian with little or no oil and I still get that great taste.,3
957,This is the best price I've found for PB2 and it's eligible for free shipping and handling. It tastes better than another powdered peanut butter product that I've tried.,3
960,"I'm on my second jar and we love this stuff. Originally bought for popping popcorn (fantastic) we soon started using it as a butter substitute for just about everything, toast, veggies, frying eggs or fish. I've had people who hate coconut anything love the mild sweet taste for popcorn. Between the coconut oil and the agave nectar found here I don't know which I'm happier with.",3
961,"My cats love the food, and it's on the HAPPY list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" linked through the PETA site, peta.org.  That is VERY reassuring.",3
972,I purchased these from Whole Foods for my friend as a gift.  She has Celiac's (sp) and always talks about how crappy gluten free treats are.  I gave her a box and she LOVED them.  I even ate one and I honestly could not tell the difference between an Oreo and Ktoo.  I recommend these cookies and Amazon is cheaper than Whole Foods.,3
989,"i ordered this on 8/29/10, and it didn't ship out until three and a half weeks later. it's 10/12/10 and i still haven't received it yet. next time, i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe.  as far as the product is concerned, i do like that the similac liquid formula in the 32oz size doesn't contain BPA. i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single-use ready-made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain BPA. i would expect more diligence from similac to be BPA-free in all of their packaging.",3
996,The plant arrived dead.  It cost as much to ship.  I did not want to hassle with any kind of return.  I should know better than to buy a plant on line.,3
998,"In my constant search for gluten free products, I was happy to find this snack bar.  Generally this type product leaves much to be desired, taste wise.  I am very pleased with the taste of this bar and will continue to use it.  I will probably end up trying all the flavors.  I have been happy to find Amazon carries such a good variety of gluten free foods.",3
1000,I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China. I threw the whole bag away. I wish I would have read the reviews first!,3
1002,These treats are great.  The dog is crazy about them.  They are small but he really likes them.  You can also use them to conceal small pills if you need to give your dog medicine.,3
1005,"My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often.",3
1007,"4-year old Elkhound loves this food, and it keeps her in great health.  Amazon has the best price I've found for this food, and it's even better with subscribe and save.  I highly recommend it.",3
1015,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...,3
1019,These are great for packing lunches or snacks on the go without all of the bad stuff you get in the other commercially available products.  Great price with the free shipping over $25 too.  Will definitely buy again.,3
1031,I like giving my son some prunes once in a while to get him regular.  The price for this 12 pack is outstanding. It came neatly packed to prevent damage. I love Earth's Best baby food.,3
1063,Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad. Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine. Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct. I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon. Will not use it again.,3
1064,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",3
1076,We use it as a coating for fish. It comes out really great. Amazon has the best price.,3
1090,Very nice product for those wanting to enjoy the pleasure of lasagna but are on a gluten free diet. Great alternative.,3
1098,This is an awesome tasting snack.  The cheapest place near us is Trader Joe's and they sell it for $1.50.  Amazon is even cheaper!  You cannot just eat one.....we finish the whole bag each time we open it!,3
1116,I am using rice pasta because a family member is gluten intolerant. This pasta tastes so good that everyone in the household eats it.,3
1118,"I have not yet tried these crackers with s'mores, but they are very good with any kind of frosting, especially cream cheese frosting - a nice, quick treat that is gluten free.",3
1119,"My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.  So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand.",3
1122,"We are white popcorn enthusiasts, and were very pleased with this product.  Large, tender kernels of poped corn.  Used an electric, self stirring poper.  Worth the cost.",3
1128,"This is by far the best tasting thing that's come from a goat in years! Bullsburg Creamery, Man Chowder Dairy or Goat Coat can't hold a candle to this stuff. Drink it, bake it, snort it...it's all good.",3
1143,"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!  How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!",3
1153,if you want a healthy treat and one that is very satisfying try the lara bars. an important plus is that is soy free which is important to a lot of people these days.,3

1174,I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!,3
1180,"I thought that this was a decent price when I ordered it. Two days later I went to a foodstore which had not carried it and found that they had begun stocking the litter for $7.98. I like this product(and so does my fussy cat), but feel that I have been ripped off.",3
1186,The first 12 were great the second 12 was spoiled But amazon contacted the supplier and shipped another batch so far they are ok.,3
1193,"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product.",3
1205,"This is one of the better gluten free crusts I've tried. I prefer it to all the pre-made crusts. It takes some prep time, but the slightly doughy texture is well worth the wait. It is good, if not better, than crust I've had in gluten free pizzerias.",3
1215,"If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though they're so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.  From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.  Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high.",3

I buy it every time I run out cause I love eating it too.",3

1240,"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.",3
1251,"These chip/crackers were very tasty... however people who have allergies or problems digesting corn - like me - need to beware. If you just read the front of the packet it seems as if they are made without wheat or corn. Not true, the main ingredient is corn.",3
1252,I have purchased these a couple times for my two dogs.  Great price (even with the expensive shipping charge) and long lasting.  There is nothing worse than paying $8 for a dog chew and then watching your dog eat it in less than 5 minutes!,3
1266,My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn't always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months.,3
1277,Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.,3
1282,"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.",3

Next time I think I will get the 50 pound bag and I won't have to worry about buying popcorn for the rest of my life. You will save a ton of money by purchasing bulk bags of seeds and a popcorn popper.

1300,"Not many processed foods are healthy.  Mary's Gone Crackers is about as good as it gets.  I enjoy them most with some raw almond butter that I get at Trader Joe's.

Highly recommend.",3
1336,"This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won't eat it :-)",3
1340,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good.",3

Simply put, these are great.  They have a wonderful, soft texture with a mildly sweet (but not too sweet) flavor.  For anyone with allergies or intolerances like myself, they're a real lifesaver.  They're satisfying, nicely packaged, and very fresh tasting.  I'll be buying more.",3
1386,After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!,3
1389,"got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room.  have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste.  probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way, but the best flavor we've found.  very happy with our purchase & will definitely buy again!",3

I had previously given one of my dogs Blue Buffalo so I knew it was a good quality food. Most of the time, my dogs are eating Blue Buffalo dry dog food and always gobble it up. Since I'm comparing to the home cooked meals I make, I find the dogs drink a lot more water and have more stools which isn't fun for clean up. Otherwise, the dogs are maintaining a good weight and their coats look healthy with a supplement of Salmon oil each day. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product.",3

Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern) Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died. The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats.",3
1576,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":  Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food   Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts   My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.  I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.  I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!  But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.  Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!",3
1578,"I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.  Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it.",3
1580,"I started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies (I bought the puppy-lover's bag).  I loved that it has wholesome ingredients, and that ""meat"" is the first ingredient on the list.  Look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you'll see that meat isn't first or second, and then when you find it you'll find it only contains ""meat by-products.""  My pets have had a healthy coat & firm stools eating this brand of dog food, and you can't beat the price.  The added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food.  I will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well.",3
1596,"I found these for much less ($2.50 + $2.55) at two other places here on amazon, do not buy from here, free shipping not worth it",3
1597,"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!",3
1634,"Great food for my cat.  He always looks healthy, sleek, and shiny.  Has been his diet for 3 years.  The last time I ordered this food from Amazon it was around $11.  Why the big price increase?  Will look local now.",3
1639,"I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl.",3
1642,"I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best.",3
1643,So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly. Relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it.,3
1655,"Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in",3
1656,"My 4 border collies expect one of these each night before bed.  I've learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active ""wired"" dogs calm, and there's no way I have time to brush their teeth each nite, even if they'd let me.  But this can get very expensive.  When I found them here at this price, I ordered tons.  Then went back and ordered more, figuring the price would increase to that on other sites.  It had increased a bit, but still a great price. Entirely Pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems, but that was okay since I had just received enough to last a month!",3
1664,"My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!",3
1674,"Let your puppy naw on these for a month each. They will last for months. Alot less expensive than buying them one at a time at your local pet store. Save, Save, Save! Only complaint I have is it would be nice if they had a beef flavor added. Ever the less, my Lab chews on these rawhide bones alot.",3
1692,"My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China. It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand.",3
1703,"Used to subscribe to this item, as my dogs loved them, but I just found that they are made in china. I will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company.",3

1729,"When I got my miniature Labradoodle puppy, the breeder recommended getting one of these.  I am so glad I did.  This will entertain your dog for hours.  The inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product.  So far she has not been able to damage the ball itself, after 8 months.  For me that means it should last about two years or more before I have to replace it.  For a puppy/dog toy that is ""everlasting"".  I love it and highly recommend it.  Just a note: my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect.",3
1730,"This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.",3
1734,"Fine quality, but expensive.  You can find the same amount for 1/3 price at places like Trader Joe's.",3
1746,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.,3
1759,"I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin...",3
1769,I had my dog on PetSmart's brand of food that is gluten free.  But it came in small bags and they charged an arm and a leg to ship a larger bag.  Chicken Soup got a great review from dog food review sites.  My dog eats it and seems to love it.,3
1776,"Ever since starting my diet/change of life a couple years ago, I started cutting out sugar drinks, and substitution with Crystal Light.

We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, "" A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China."" (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that ""small number"" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?  We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.",3

When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats.

1842,This is the only food I have been feeding my dog since I took him off puppy chow.  He loves it.  His coat is soft and shiny and I haven't had any health problems.  He is a 3.5 year old mini dachshund so this small breed formula works well for him.,3
1883,She liked the food a little at first but didn't want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if she'll only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction.,3
1888,This is a staple in our gluten free household.  It is great for converting non gluten free recipes to gluten free recipes and getting good texture.  Easy to use.  I am very happy to have found it.,3
1895,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!",3
1904,"Other reviewers must have expected these to taste like candy bars, which they don't.  But they are delicious!  Pay no attention to the bad reviews if you like real food!  My mother and I recently switched over to these instead of other energy bars because they have real ingredients instead of junk and fillers and what a difference!  They are dense and chewy without being dry, and are all-in-all wonderful.",3
1905,"I purchased the same bag from the vet for $10.  When my dog was diagnosed with Addison's disease I concludeded that I would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life.  Not only do they work; he wouldn't take the prednisone in cheese or other foods, but you do not need to use the entire pill each time.  I just break away enough so that it covers his pill and he loves it!  Great product at a great price!",3
1907,"This is definitely different than any other raw honey I've tried, and its fantastic, with three small kids i can't afford to be sick and a few spoonfuls of this stuff a day helps soothe a sore throat when I'm dealing with an innless or scratchy throat from allergies, and i could swear it also boosts my mood and energy. It also seems to help digestive problems, i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home. I also love that this stuff doesn't have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey. totally with the money, and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found. My local whole foods charges almost double for the stuff!",3
1916,"this popcorn is very good. its cheap, but it doesn't taste like it. very fluffy. this is the perfect popcorn for people who don't want to spend 6 bucks on 3 bags of popcorn.",3
1919,I like this a lot as a topping on my popcorn instead of butter. It's very good and has kept well in the refrigerator after several months. I will order more.  Update: I bought a second batch. I didn't have room in my fridge so I've been leaving it in the pantry. I've had it a few months now and it still tastes great.,3
1923,"I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!  The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up).",3
1928,"I have been buying the fireworks popcorn from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I bought this to try something different. First of all I was disappointed by the rather small container for the price, but then I was very disappointed by the taste. I use canola oil in an electric popper. This popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide. I tasted it in every batch from the jar. It was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste.",3
1929,"My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking.",3
1931,"When I first took a bite, I seriously thought I was eating dog food.  These are disgusting.  I searched the bag for ""dog food"" and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons.  I don't know how anyone can like these.",3
1954,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.  Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.  When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.  Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.",3
1958,"They're not for the faint of heart. I get so bored with most foods that claim to be spicy hot, but Shin Ramyun delivers. And it's not just hot, it's got great taste. I've been buying them by the 20-pack for years and loving every bite.",3
1964,With the economy so tight I feel fortunate to have found the cat food my cats like for a price I can afford.  Thanks!,3
1967,"I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does. Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.  She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.  But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the ""occasional upset"" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!!",3

Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!",3

2001,"Obviously opinions vary on this, but I eat Enjoy life granola daily.  I don't understand the comments about it not being crunchy, unless perhaps people have had outdated bags. I appreciate Enjoy Life being dairy, soy and corn free as well as gluten free, as I can't have any of these.  The Cranapple flavor is the best--I mix it with Erehwon Gluten-free brown rice cereal and use vanilla rice milk.  Since opinions differ so on this product, if you're on a gluten-free diet you should try it.",3

2035,"I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again.",3
2038,"My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic. This is low in protein and fat, so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike. My dogs go crazy over these. They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth. Amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price. Specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as Amazon does, so I suggest you buy them from Amazon. If you want a healthy treat, this is the way to go. :)",3

2052,"When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food.",3
2056,"My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854). to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations.",3

The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",3

2141,"I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE.",3
2149,The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesn't stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty.,3

2163,"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again.",3
2174,"I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again. It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick. AVOID!",3
2178,"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables. I stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy. She always finishes it, and its one of our favorites.",3

2187,"This is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great.  My German Shepard, like the others, has horrible food allergies.  I tried the Royal Canine Venison which was OK but when I tried this, my dog, who is never that excited about food, went crazy.  He loves the taste, his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier.  Yes it is expensive, but worth it!",3
2189,I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.  Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.  Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):  (1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)  (2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US  (3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)  (4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.  Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.,3
2202,"Rosemary is nothing like Peppermint ! As it has much more subtle taste ! At a Tablespoon in 20 oz. of drinking water it is still not harsh, kind of mild ! According to Miracle Food Cures from the Bible it is supposed to help with memory and old age ! It's easy to imagine Rosemary Chicken ! Over seasoning would be hard to do ! This great stuff as it has been around a long time ! Thank You !!!!",3

I thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and I was right - she really liked them, especially the purple kind. We cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly. However, don't be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face! Does NOT feel good. Popcorn has a great, distinct flavor and I think we will be returning for more.",3

2216,"I got a sample of these in the mail and I tried them one night after ravaging my pantry for something crunchy and tasty. Boy, did these hit the spot they are so good they have now replaced my love for cheetos and jax. They are crunchy and cheesy and OMG they are just unbelieveably good and good for me too. What more could a girl ask for?",3
2229,I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!,3
2240,"I'm not a coconut oil savant, but I got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it's awesome.  It's not super-greasy, very light, cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness (although my husband says it doesn't get the coconut hint, but he misses a lot of hints).  It shipped quickly, was well-packaged, and is a good price, I didn't want to buy a ton in case we didn't like it.",3

2249,I purchased these ears because of the excellent price. And was shocked to see the quality. each ear was individually wrapped like one of the reviews mentioned. Also fresh.  I love the fact that they are individually wrapped you can take them with you.  The dachshunds and lab Luv them...... I definitely would purchase this brand again..,3
2251,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on.",3
2261,"The taste is bitter, the smell is atrocious, and they are not naturally smoked.  ""Aqueous natural smoke"" is a chemical stew injected into the fish.  For anyone thinking these are the real thing, all I can say is 'there is a sucker born every minute.'",3

This is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most Americans eat.  I enjoy the taste, and it doesn't leave me starving by mid morning.  The price is also more reasonable when I buy it by the case.",3
2284,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!",3
2285,"We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking.",3

2296,This coating has just enough seasoning to make fried chicken very tasty. The flavor doesn't overwhelm. It makes it easy to make fried chicken at home.,3
2312,"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!",3
2314,"Like many of the other reviewers, I've tried all of the premium dog foods out there. When our family hit some tough financial times, I began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget. This food absolutely fits the bill.  My golden retriever mix is not crazy about it, but that doesn't bother me that much--he's a good weight, and he will eat it when he's hungry.  He's had some allergy issues in the past and I was sure this food would kick them into gear, but it didn't--after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all.  I'm definitely going to stick with Chicken Soup... why pay twice as much on dog food if you don't have to?",3
2318,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""  So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.  We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)  It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).  Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.",3

2330,Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.,3
2332,"We have a 4 year old granddaughter and another grand-baby on the way, so when we saw these snacks on Amazon, we thought we'd try them out to see if they would be healthy and TASTY for a child. No good having a healthy snack that the kids won't eat, huh?  Sara (the 4 year old) is such a picky eater that we had serious doubts, and thought she may turn up her nose as she does with so many other healthy foods. She LOVES the Little Ducks! It feels so good to give her something she loves that is helping her grow and develop without all the processed additives and sweeteners. We love too that the package has a zip-top closure and fits easily into a purse. Go to the Little Ducks web site, too.",3
2340,"Beats other brands by a mile. Love the taste, kinda earthy, milky smooth & has a straw like aftertaste that does not linger. High in Omega 3 & 6 too. But wonder why Amazon dealers sell over retail is mind blowing, especially on a case you'd expect a big discount. My local health food store has it for two eighty two a box.",3
2371,"My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  You'd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(  So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time.",3
2373,"This company makes all their food with the highest, natural ingredients, but this ""limited ingredients"" one is the best. I learned that cats cannot digest carbohydrates. So, many cats have stomach problems and sensitive stomachs, like my kitty. I switched my cat over to this food and his stools are firmer and less smelly and he NEVER throws up.  My cat gobbled up the food right away. I highly recommend this!",3
2378,"I compared so many different dog food brands before I settled on Blue Buffalo.  I used to feed my swiss mountain dogs Holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal (presumably to save $$).  Blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with Amazon prime.  Call me a nut but I always taste the food I feed my dogs so I can get a real idea of what I am feeding them, because lets be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them.  Lets just say that Blue Buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than Holistic or Eagle Pack did.  I also add a little pro-biotic to their food to help with digestion.  I will be buying Blue Buffalo in the future for my boys.",3
2386,"After having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule, which later turned out to be cancer, I thought I had better try to get more iodine in my and my family's diet.  After researching some, I found that Dulse is a great natural source of iodine.  I tried a package of this, and found that it is pretty good.  The package came with a suggestion to stir-fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet, to make it like ""chips"", which I tried.  I and my family enjoyed it much better that way.  The quality of this dulse is great, and the price seemed comparable with others I could find.  I ordered more of this, and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet.",3
2420,"I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time. I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had ""healthy"" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food. It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try.",3
2426,"This is, at $1 a can, the most expensive cat food that I've purchased.  It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given.",3

2458,"Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.  However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.  Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.",3

2462,"I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!",3
2473,"This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.  I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill.",3

2524,"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.  Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.  I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.  I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.  Theo.",3

I look forward to the day that Pamela's expands their product line!",3
2557,"In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.  Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.",3
2574,Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.,3
2585,"My daughters favorite food is pears, and she also loves her green vegetables. Now both of them combined is the perfect combination, and they're the perfect size.

It's also an easy on the go food for your baby if you have multiple places to go. I had no problem rating this product 5 stars.",3

2611,"My dog LOVED these treats.  Then one day, i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china!  I feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken, when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices.  They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!

The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread.

But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)",3

""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring. The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.

I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.  Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat ""meal"" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated).",3

I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction.

I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.  I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.  We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.

I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.

FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]",3

However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing.",3
3319,"Great tasting healthy snack.  And when I say great tasting, I mean it, I am very picky about food, so it is not ""great tasting"" for super health conscious people who only eat bad tasting health bars.  And it's great to know you are getting a ton of fiber which most of us do not get enough of!",3
3333,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup. They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.  They like the dollar store dog food better than this.  Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.,3
3357,"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.  I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter.""",3
3362,I use this flour to bake bread for my grandson who is on a gluten free diet.  I like the fact that is has no additives and that it is organic.  Can't beat the price!,3
3366,"My wife has a difficult time getting enough iron, and supplements are very hard on her stomach.  With 70% of the USRDA of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses, she can very easily get the iron she needs.  This is not in any way hard on her stomach, either.  It tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried - a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content.  Blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients.  This definitely picked up her step within a very short time (she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron).  We will definitely be buying this again.",3
3380,To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.,3

The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure.

3407,"I've been gluten free for about three months, and as someone with a sweet tooth, I've been a bit bummed lately at the lack of easy and quick treats I can find or keep on hand.  I went to the health food store and bought one of these individually to give it a try. I opened it in the car and almost went back in for more right then! Only the rain and a need to get on with my day held me back. I will most definitely be buying more.  If you like macaroons, these are fairly similar, crunchy but chewy, soft, sweet and tasty.",3
3408,I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  It's just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper.,3

We served it with shrimp and tomato sauce and everyone loved it. We will definitely get this brand again next time we have a chance.",3

3442,"This is a good product and very high-quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic), it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value. We've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk. Abbott labs (product maker) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in-place, published research, and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community (exacting standards). That said, I would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula (ie. other organic products suggested as ""better"" in these reviews - especially the referenced small-name organic powders). All said and done, the components in ALL of the Similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well-researched in published studies. I'd trust this brand - Similac, over the smaller, no-names. Plain and simple. Keep in mind it's what best suits your baby and with nascent/developing GI tracts, ALL babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source (even breastmilk). It's sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians/physicians. Do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives, as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased.",3
3444,Great value for an Organic Infant formula. We have the subscription model which gets the price lower. Comparable canisters cost at least $28 a canister. Our baby loved the product from day one.,3
3448,"I gave this product a try since being a gluten and dairy free person limits snacks, this tastes really good and its hard just to have a few.  I will continue to purchase this product.",3
3450,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",3

3473,"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still ""Made in China"" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again.",3
3480,"These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original ""Chips Ahoy!"" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.",3
3489,These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.,3
3492,This product smells so bad that I couldn't even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I'm out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.,3
3503,"I wish Rihanna would get her face off this product.  It tastes nasty.  I bought a couple dozen since I love Vita Coco's products. However, this flavor is just the worst.

I tried mixing my own xylitol (sugar alcohol) with cinnamon - it doesn't come out that well. But this product - it is JUST GREAT! There is no aftertaste whatsoever!  I highly recommend it.",3
3512,"I just got my order today and had to try it out. While I'll disagree with others that have gotten 'mush' outta the can, my initial can was above that. Not what I would call chunks by any stretch, but not mush.  As for taste? Pretty much none. If it weren't for the additives, it wouldn't have any taste at all.  I've never had Blue crab. But if this is the 'comparison', I'll not try it either.  Keep in mind that I can get Dungeness year round, as well as Red Rock crab.  I'll likely add it to the cats food. Maybe she can get some flavor out of it?",3

I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help.",3
3541,I was very happy with this product.  Coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish. I ordered this in February (the cooler part of the year) and it arrived in perfect condition.  Some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place.  This is probably due to the product becoming liquid at 76 degrees.  My oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem.  I hope Amazon can resolve this issue quickly.,3
3546,I love the taste of this. I used it to pop my corn in. It made the popcorn all buttery. I have to deduct a star because when it gets cool it leaves that film that crisco-like shortenings do on the roof of your mouth. I hate that. And it has trans-fats.,3

It is a tasty licorice.",3
3585,All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture.

3625,"My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.

I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.

3672,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.   Karl and Lori  Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.",3

3704,"Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):  Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.  If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.  My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her. What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her.  Sure, this food is a little more expensive than other products, but all in all it's well worth it. A must have -your cat will thank you!",3
3705,"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.  I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.  I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing.",3

3783,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.  TRY THIS INSTEAD:  Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag",3

Also, my older dog tends to get really ""diggy"" when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch!  I have no idea what is wrong with this food, none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up!",3

She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch....,3

My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.  But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.  I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.  I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower, my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.

I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae.",3

I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible)).",3

4175,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]",3

She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at:  Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)   Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.  In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.

Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:  Me:  opening the bag ""you want a treat?"" Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"".  She looks back up at me.  ""sniff"".  She walks away and lays down in her bed. Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside ""wrapping"".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.  I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.

And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...",3
