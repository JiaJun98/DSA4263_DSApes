17,"My husband and I love to cook.  Jarred sun-dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment.  Not these! Flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes.

I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didn't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  I've been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.

Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.

I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least.","['prune', 'permanent', 'diet', 'best', 'food', 'source', 'antioxidant', 'b', 'sweet', 'sugar', 'substitute', 'craving', 'um', 'um', 'constipation', 'careful', 'couple', 'time', 'problem', 'limit', 'banana', 'raisin', 'raisin', 'raisin', 'antioxidant', 'fact', 'second', 'prune', 'half', 'strong', 'kind', 'prune', 'sunsweet', 'best', 'best', 'consistency', 'mushy', 'cardboard', 'thim', 'fridge', 'strictlyl', 'unnecessary', 'couple', 'week', 'open', 'better', 'room', 'temperature', 'consistent', 'surprise', 'store', 'oz', 'canister', 'buck', 'page', 'sort', 'error', 'online', 'price', 'better', 'six-to-seven', 'time', 'bottomline', 'sort', 'prune', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'fact', 'time', 'sale', 'two-seventy', 'piece', 'local', 'drugstore', 'careful', 'price', 'bit', 'second', 'price', 'avoid', 'subscription', 'extra', 'discount', 'price', 'racket', 'stay', 'clear', 'p', 'trader', 'joe', 'prune', 'resealable', 'plastic', 'bag', 'pound', 'oz', 'two-eighty-nine', 'tenth', 'guy']",3

I was disappointed but decided to give Amazon.com a shot and see if I could find them here.  And I did!  They even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month, 3 months, or 6 months and the price for a case is reasonable (especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free - just buying a case costs WAY too much with shipping).  I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.  And I found that having a case on hand is nice and so we're getting them every 6 months - that gives us time to eat what we want, share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them.

At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).

2318,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""  So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.  We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)  It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).  Give autoship a try.

This makes it really sweet with no aftertaste.  In fact, you can say that it almost has a hint of honey (must be the agave inulin)  It dissolves quickly too.  A packet equals 2 tsp of sugar.  I like 1 tsp in my cup of coffe so I use only half a packet at a time.  It is very good though.  Considering that it is organic and natural, the price is slightly above what I would pay, but I think it's ok if you're used to buying other products with stevia.

I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.
