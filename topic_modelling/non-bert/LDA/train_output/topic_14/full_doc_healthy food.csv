The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie.

Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.  As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.  I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.  I really want to like this company.

The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet.

2148,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""

Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste. Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered.

We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.

3910,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.","['ok', 'bisquick', 'gf', 'thing', 'drop', 'box', 'kind', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'result', 'gf', 'bisquick', 'original', 'tart', 'original', 'similar', 'buttermilk', 'buttermilk', 'milk', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'odd', 'problem', 'new', 'mix', 'right', 'box', 'cup', 'mix', 'box', 'serving', 'cup', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'cup', 'mix', 'teaspoonful', 'measuring', 'cup', 'cup', 'mix', 'bag', 'mix', 'wheat', 'flour', 'kind', 'flour', 'measure', 'bag', 'cup', 'recipe', 'misprint', 'box', 'biscuit', 'gravy', 'butter', 'jam', 'yummy', 'mcdonald', 'breakfast', 'sandwich', 'instruction', 'lot', 'biscuit', 'single', 'recipe', 'half', 'plenty', 'box', 'mix', 'cost', 'box', 'biscuit', 'budget', 'biscuit', 'golden', 'recipe', 'egg', 'crumbly', 'glutenous', 'one', 'egg', 'eye-appealing', 'color', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'cut-in', 'shortening', 'cutter', 'long', 'fork', 'difficult', 'celiac', 'biscuit', 'cutter', 'box', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'milk', 'tart', 'reminiscent', 'original', 'bisquick', 'mix', 'rice', 'flour', 'sugar', 'potato', 'starch', 'salt', 'xanthum', 'mix', 'goody', 'rice', 'flour', 'grainy', 'bisquick', 'fantastic', 'job', 'rice', 'flour', 'repeat', 'new', 'starch', 'corn', 'potato', 'tapioca', 'normal', 'lightness', 'baked', 'item', 'possible', 'rice', 'leavening', 'soda', 'powder', 'necessary', 'sugar', 'salt', 'flavor', 'consistency', 'yes', 'necessary', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'celiac-safe', 'baked', 'good', 'bit', 'elasticity', 'replacement', 'gluten', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'baked', 'goodie', 'people', 'celiac', 'disease', 'mix', 'money', 'sure', 'difficult', 'time', 'ground', 'rice', 'flour', 'predominant', 'main', 'ingredient', 'mix', 'recipe', 'box', 'pancake', 'waffle', 'shortcake', 'crust', 'ultimate', 'chicken', 'finger', 'chicken', 'recipe', 'website', 'mix', 'box', 'price']",12

4142,This item shipped quickly and looked nice but it fell apart after about two weeks.  Look elsewhere for a komboloi.,"['item', 'looked', 'week', 'komboloi']",12
4152,Product was clean and in a good package.  As I could not find this item locally I looked to Amazon.  Price seemed a touch high except I have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair.  In any event I was glad to get it anyway.  I purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items.  These people seem to take care of their products.,"['clean', 'package', 'item', 'price', 'touch', 'high', 'mung', 'dal', 'fair', 'event', 'tumric', 'spice', 'packaging', 'item', 'people', 'care', 'product']",12

4231,"All the Wylers singles to go are great!  They taste good and mix easily in bottled water.  Most places are overcharging for this item.  Walgreen's sells a package of 8 for $1.00 (or less; It was $0.59 a package of 8 over memorial day).  Most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating $1.00 per box.  I see some places charging over $2 per box.  At that rate, you can buy a 12 ounce can of soda (even big brands when they are on special,) and you get the can and the water included! So why spend that much just for the powder?","['wyler', 'single', 'mix', 'bottled', 'water', 'place', 'item', 'walgreen', 'package', 'package', 'memorial', 'box', 'box', 'box', 'place', 'box', 'rate', 'ounce', 'big', 'brand', 'special', 'water', 'powder']",12
