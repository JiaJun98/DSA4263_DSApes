1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.","['citrus', 'drink', 'sweet', 'sour', 'bubble', 'sparkle', 'addition', 'punch', 'favorite', 'fruit', 'juice', 'draw', 'tad', 'bit', 'expencive', 'family', 'normal', 'beverage', 'choice', 'terrific', 'treat', 'occational', 'indulgence']",1

24,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.","['vine', 'se', 'carbonated', 'water', 'concentrate', 'mixture', 'apple', 'grape', 'tangerine', 'acai', 'concentrate', 'list', 'apple', 'grape', 'common', 'fruit', 'sweetener', 'beverage', 'taste', 'calorie', 'lot', 'oz', 'carbonated', 'water', 'carbohydrate', 'gram', 'carbs', 'gram', 'sugar', 'apple', 'grape', 'highest', 'concentration', 'fructose', 'fruit', 'sugar', 'commercial', 'beverage', 'sweeter', 'regular', 'cane', 'sugar', 'cheaper', 'diarrhea', 'child', 'drink', 'hit', 'parade', 'pretend', 'healthy', 'drinks-', 'mass', 'concern', 'ever-growing', 'girth', 'continued', 'growth', 'better', 'diet', 'coke', 'better', 'sparkling', 'water', 'calorie', 'favorite', 'bella', 'familglia', 'pomegranate', 'lime', 'lemon', 'orange', 'flavor', 'time', 'time', 'local', 'supermarket', 'organic', 'pure', 'fruit', 'juice', 'pomegranate', 'pour', 'cup', 'glass', 'favorite', 'sparking', 'water', 'quarter', 'cup', 'oz', 'bottle', 'favorite', 'sparkling', 'water', 'actual', 'juice', 'fructose', 'extract']",1
28,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.

I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it.

In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.  I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind.

This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.  The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.  If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch.

When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.

429,"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement.

I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks.

3007,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.","['celtic', 'game', 'friend', 'apartment', 'game', 'intense', 'parched', 'hey', 'brian', 'yeah', 'lavender', 'soda', 'fridge', 'lavender', 'soda', 'skeptical', 'person', 'lavender', 'soda', 'table', 'couch', 'furniture', 'section', 'marshall', 'brian', 'kitchen', 'lavender', 'soda', 'unique', 'experience', 'scent', 'lavender', 'soap', 'flower-flavored', 'soda', 'exciting', 'experience', 'sip', 'time', 'initial', 'flavor', 'club', 'soda', 'glass', 'soap', 'previous', 'cleaning', 'flavor', 'subtle', 'drinking', 'experience', 'case', 'soda', 'aftertaste', 'soap', 'residue', 'like', 'soap', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'horrible', 'memory', 'childhood', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'mouth', 'soap', 'bad', 'word', 'disrespectful', 'father', 'mother', 'conviction', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'tremendous', 'lasting', 'psychological', 'effect', 'year', 'flavor', 'soap', 'mouth', 'bad', 'word', 'lavender', 'soda', 'flood', 'emotion', 'bad', 'word', 'rule', 'vision', 'cloudy', 'control', 'small', 'motor', 'function', 'bluthering', 'mess', 'floor', 'deeply-buried', 'memory', 'soda', 'lest', 'episode', 'summary', 'soda', 'lavender-scented', 'soap', 'delicate', 'palate']",1

If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).  Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.

It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.

Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.

We only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks, but so far I have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor.  If you like a bright, citrus-y taste that is not too overpowering, you will love this.

4098,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.  I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.

I don't like splenda very much and can't stand sweet n low. Been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt. Excited!

4224,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).

4277,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes.
