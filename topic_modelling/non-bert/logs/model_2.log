Current topic: breakfast_tea

I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.

Not only is this tea delicious, but it's organic and very cheap! I've bought Rooibos from over 5 other stores, and it has never been this cheap or this good! Davidson's for the win

I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn't do a bit of good.  Very disappointing.

I love the flavor of this tea, even though it is decaffeinated, it is one of the few decaf teas that still have a good robust taste.  This and the Irish Breakfast (Decaf) are among my favorites.

Have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible.  The only "bad" thing I can say about it is that it can be a little addictive :)  Follow up: We usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends (half-nhalf - what's that??).  The other day we were out so I used the Santini condensed milk instead.  All I can say is, wow!  Actually enjoyed it more than cream - and then I compared the labels.  The condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream.  We're never going back!

I am already a fan/buyer of Lipton's herbal tea, having tried the  Island Mango & Peach ,  the Mandarin Orange  and  Blueberry Pomegranate .  I like the fact that the ingredients are natural - hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry. It's definitely 'herbal' tea - there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients (which is why it's caffeine free).  I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)  I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.  Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea.

My only complaint is that on the bottom of the package, the expiration date is 2001.  I don't think that's correct.  I made several cups of tea before I noticed it, and figured that since I hadn't had any adverse effects, either it was incorrect or it didn't matter.  It tastes refreshing and smells great! The combination of coconut and green tea is awesome!

This adds something special to a regular burger and fries.  My husband loves spicy foods and he loves the kick that this gives him.

Current topic: coffee

This is a smooth coffee with a good taste.  I don't like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect.  It has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all.

I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.

These pumpkin seeds were exactly the same as the ones they sell at markets for nearly $4 for half the price.

Tasted bland - did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions - Would not buy again

This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old?? Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy.

I have always been a fan of Annie's products, and since I'm overseas at the moment, I didn' have access to the products. That's where Amazon comes in! The price is very good-almost the same as buying them in the store in the states-and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either! As for the product itself, I think the sauce can use less salt, but other wise I love it! Natural ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes for me to make it =)

THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.

I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon.

Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!

Excellent choice for a high fiber cracker.  These taste great and like other Back to Nature items, don't have all the undesirable ingredients you'd like to avoid if necessary. Whole wheat, safflower oil, salt and Vitamin E -- perfect.

I ordered this syrup on a whim and I made the right choice, it's very tasty.

The product was recieved in a timely manner. The product was in good condition and the item was in good shape.  Quality was good. Great price

These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!

This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.

I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.

the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue

Current topic: drinks

The tiny bubbles and flavor choice makes this an above average non-alcholic beverage.  Others tend to be more like soda pop.

Although this is no substitute for the real thing, the flavor is good enough when you need a substitute.

I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!

I often buy products like this to use when traveling, because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road.  This tasted like fresh-brewed tea and disolved completely.  I wasn't stuck with a residue on the bottom.  Just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor.

Really yummy!  I ate them all within 2 days!  =/  They taste better than fruit by the foot, which I also like.  I'd definitely like to buy some more in the future.

Product was received from vendor quickly.  It is the best tasting non calorie juice around.  So glad to be able to get it here.  thanks

I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that I'd need to drink 2-3 cans at a time -- 8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.  If it came in a 20oz can, I'd be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.  Really tasty product, though, and I've got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum.

Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.

Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .

I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free. However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!  This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON. I will not be purchasing this item again.

Very pleased with the quality of this product. A beginner at cake decorating this was very easy to work with and the flavor was great as expressed by all that tasted it. Will be ordering more product from this company.

This was the best ever fruitcake. Loaded with fruit and nuts, lite on the cake, as it should be. Not like others, all cake and not much in the way fruit and nuts. The only problem I had is that it's all gone, and fast. Must now order more.

This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The "mouth feel" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an "emergency treat" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.

Neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products, but we love cornbread.  This mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us.  Nice to find an alternative that tastes so great!  Appreciate having this order size option as well since it's often missing from grocery store shelves.

Tried this and the Chicken, neither left a pleasant taste at all. They were bitter and just not good for a soup base.

BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER

For a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water.,,,nothing can beat Dr. McDougall's Split Pea Soup with Barley. This is the best "instant soup" that is on the market.

I switched my dogs to this food and I have noticed many improvements in there overall health.  They have shinny healthy coats of fur, more energy and more regular and solid bowel movements.  I care about my dog's health and this product delivers good healthy ingredients and my dogs really love it!

This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!

A treat for my dogs that is actually good for them. Also at much better price than I had found previously at my local retailers....Great product at a huge savings - what could be better!

I lived in Europe when I was and would purchase these from street-side kiosks. These are good however I "age" them to greatness by leaving the cover off for about a week. This gives the belts just the right amount of staleness and brings back the nostalgia of youth.

If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.

these are very pricey so i only enjoy them now and then as a treat but the flavor is wonderfull and the packaging is very nice. would make a wonderfull gift to send to someone who likes such dainties. i will order again when i run out, truly a nice treat.

[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago.  I was very disappointed with the quality.  I was unable to eat these sardines.  They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture.  Sorry product.  I'm giving them to the cats.  B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]

I like this product because it has a lot of protein, and WHEY protein since I am allergic to soy which is in almost everything else. It tastes good, promises no junk included, and seems to work well for me.

Several people have written in to say that their Larabars were old and crumbly.  I just received a box of 16 Chocolate Coconut Chew Larabars and they are in date, moist, have a good consistency, and are delicious.  This is a perfect mid-morning or after workout snack.  I love that they are raw, vegan, Kosher, contain all-natural ingredients and have no processed sugar.  These taste better, are healthier, and have a better texture than most lines of exercise-oriented energy bars.

I discovered Think Thin products at my local Trader Joe's market. But, the per bar price was a bit high. Then I saw that Amazon sold them and had so many more flavors. I have been ordering them one by one. This is one of my favorites. I like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate. It may be a little too sweet. I like the darker chocolate with the nuts better. But, if you're looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts, this is a good choice. I use them as a breakfast food mostly. They don't raise my blood glucose and that's good.

My kids love these, and like a lot of reviewers have said, they don't have corn syrup or chemical artificial sweeteners in them. It's still candy, but treat wise.. it's a treat I don't mind my kids having in moderation.

The Cinnamon Roll flavors are not quite as good as the other Larabars.  There is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes.  However, they are still very tasty!

This is a great tasting product. It doesn't have any sugar. It flows just like honey!

Just a hint of honey and lemon, perfect balance, great taste, doesnt even need to be sweetened.

I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.

When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate.

It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore.

I eat quite a bit of sushi, and I have to say this sushi nori is up to par. Overall, the flavor is fine and the quality is amazing for the price. Can't do much better than this if you're trying to be conservative with what you spend on sushi.

I rarely can find this on the Keurig website, it's usually sold out, plus it's more expensive. If you love chocolate, you should love this. I recommend it!

These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!).

This was a great price as opposed to the Wal-Mart price for the same brand. My kids love to eat these as an after school snack and this price allows me to provide them with this.  Olivia

This product is fantastic.  I have had Creme Brulee many times in France and this is just the same! I would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it.

We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again

We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.

I could eat this right out of the jar.  I am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter I use in my smoothies.  It is alot less messy and tastes delicious.  Even my husband is surprised. Luv it!

I discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it.  Went looking for it cheaper and found it here.  Was shocked by the 2 poor reviews.  Come on - you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi, with a very minimal ingredient/additive list.  Did you think it would taste as "good" as the versions loaded with white flour, sugar and oils?  The product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce I put over it.

Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!

This "squeezy fruit" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don't understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don't pay this price, that's crazy!

My husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we HAD to try these!! Very quick and easy. Don't need anything but the meat. But you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner! :)

Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.  Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.  They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.

Shame on you! These are great mixers and the 5-packs are on sale at Target for just under 8 bucks each!

A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !

Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.

Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.

I had my doubts about these chips until I got my first case. I always loved and considered, ranch, & sour cream & onion pringle potato chips as the best until I open my first bag of these. Let me tell you, no chip is better than these are; I got excellent taste buds to prove it. Therefore, if these chips are extremely good to me , then I know they will be tasty to other people. Try a bag and you will see, trust me.

I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.  I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.

I split this bag up into a bunch of sandwich bags and bring them to work with me, they are great little snacks!

I ordered these because I needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor. I had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually! I recieved exactly 4 broken suckers in the whole pack of 48. I didn't think that was bad at all for such a fragile product!

Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up.
