0,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).  Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.  There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.  1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.  2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.  Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.  If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.","Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as  Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count  and  Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count ), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.  I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.  I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.","To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.  For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.  My favorite k-cups are: Starbucks French Roast Starbucks Caffe Verona Starbucks Pike Place Roast Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Green Mountain Revv Green Mountain Dark Magic  Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold","Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China... I will not trust these as safe treats. Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3/09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12/18/08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.  Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern) Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died. The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats.","I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.","UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.","The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup.","As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good.","I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!","This product is the usual Gevalia finely ground coffee.  Full-strength it did not seem be all that great. I enjoyed it much better when I blended the product with 'regular' coffee. Maybe it is just the way I brew coffee that is wrong, or I have the wrong kind of brewer (basket instead of cone, like the Gevalia-brand brewers). I am not a big fan of flavored coffee, of any brand, because I think they processor can mask poor-grade product with fancy additives.  It has very good dark-chocolate flavor. I am not sure how good a value it will as I do not have access to that info at this point."
1,"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.  I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.  The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.  The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.  I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough.","I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.  Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.","I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.  The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids.","I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!","I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).  My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver.","I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a ""Kid"" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good.  The first two ingredients are Apple Puree and Apple Juice, and the rest of the ingredients are added vitamins & minerals (plus pectin and wax to give the juice and puree structure).  Yes I know, these are full of sugar - apple juice concentrate is another way of saying ""sugar - apple flavored"".  But as far as a sugary treat goes, this one at least has some vitamins and even a smidge of fiber hidden inside.  It's tasty and I get my candy craving out of the way.  It's mostly organic, so I don't have to worry about my treat putting pesticides into the environment.  Maybe a real apple is better for you, but this will do in a pinch.","Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks   no caffeine   no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you) Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)   can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it   lots of calories  I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.  I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.","I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.  Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.  I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.  So this product is all the good things rolled into one:  100% fruit juice No added sugar Bubbly Awesome orange flavor  It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy.","In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.  All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.  I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.","In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.

2,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein.  First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious.  They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein.  The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.  Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.  As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either.  Below is the main nutritional info:  Calories  180 Total Fat  5g   Sat fat  2g Sodium  250mg Carbs  30g   FIBER  6g PROTEIN  9g","I use SunButter as part of a program to lower blood pressure, and it works, but I'd eat SunButter anyway simply for the taste of it! If you love sunflower seeds, this is a product for you. Many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but can't digest seeds (folks with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, for example). They can, however, enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product. I but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house! It tastes best (in my humble opinion) on toast.  It is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products, but I stir it up as soon as I open a jar, then refrigerate it. The oil doesn't separate again (although I do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast).  Highly recommended.","I've tried other nut butters in the past, but couldn't get past the grainy texture and the ho-hum taste. This one changed all that! I LOVE crunchy peanut butter, and this crunchy almond butter did not let me down. Very creamy texture (no graininess AT ALL)with a robust nutty flavor, with nice substantial almond pieces throughout. It works well in a dip I make, and is wonderful in sandwiches. It spreads easily and thankfully isn't separated with a layer of oil on top like other nut butters I've tried. This product will replace peanut better in my house! My favorite lunch is an almond butter and blackberry jam sandwich on pumpernickel bread...drool....","Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.  You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.  Perfect in every way, and organic!  The only ""con"" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).  The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.  If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.  These things are AMAZING","If you are looking for a tasty snack, look no further.  These caramel Fiber One bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar.  The consistency is chewy, but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth.  Since each bar provides 35% of daily recommended fiber, it's relatively healthy as well.  For those individuals that are on Weight Watchers, these bars are 2 points each... and well worth it.  I highly recommend this snack.  I also recommend the peanut butter Fiber One bars, although they are not quite as tasty, in my opinion.   Fiber One Bars Oats And Peanut Butter, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)","I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.  To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.  One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.","Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.","I purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch.  The texture is a bit hard (moat if not all protein bars are hard) but these Special K Protein Bars tastes great!  With 10 grams of protein per bar, it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there.  I only have other protein bars that I use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these Special K bars tastes the best to me.  I will be buying more!","I used to be allergic to peanuts as a child, and I have a strong taste aversion to peanuts and peanut butter, but I love almond butter. After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds.","I've never had Mallomars before.  I live in Wisconsin, and do not know if they make it all the way over here.  The only time I ever remember hearing the name before is in the Simpsons episode ""Hurricane Neddy"" when nice-guy Flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town.  Upon getting to the portly Police Chief Wiggum he says, ""The only case you've gotten to the bottom of was a CASE OF MALLOMARS!!!""  I assume by what I've read that they are a fall only type product, like the McRib.  I am also informed by the box that they are a New York kinda thing.  Regardless, I'm glad Vine gave me the chance to try them, because they are SO GOOD!!!  The crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s'mores like experience that truly satisfies.  An excellent snack.  Buy a box today."
3,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.  The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.  What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.","I'm not an expert on macaroni cheese from a box. I love the real thing, but it is time consuming. I've tried Kraft Macaroni Cheese, but I wasn't impressed. I read the good reviews for this Annie's product. I wanted to get the subscription to save money, but 12 packets was too many to buy, when I didn't even know if I would like it.  I went to Walmarts and was lucky to get a packet, they didn't have many. I just compared the prices, in Walmart it costs $1.62 a box. On Amazon with the subscription, a box costs $1.23, that's a big saving.  I made it yesterday, and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar, after it was cooked, then put it under the grill to melt the cheese. I was going to eat half and heat the rest up today, it was quite a lot for one person. It tasted so good, I ended eating all of it! If you like mature cheddar you'll probably like this. It is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it. It tastes almost as good as the reat thing.  I ordered it on subscription yesterday, I can't wait to try it again.","Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.  Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch.","These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again. Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores.","I enjoy Indian food but unfortunately the closest Indian restaurant is 150 miles away from my house. I've tried other commercial Indian food products and have not been very pleased. The Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry, however, is tasty, just spicy enough for me (well, maybe a little on the mild side), and easy to make. I buy the Costco rotisserie chicken, debone it, put it in 1 pound zip-lock bags, and freeze them. Each envelope of the Butter Curry needs 1 pound of chicken, so I just pop the chicken out of the freezer, defrost it, add the curry paste and butter, and in about 20 minutes I have a delicious dinner. I will definitely be ordering this product again.","this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry, at the time i loved it, made it all the time, then i discovered a better brand of curry paste, hand brand curry paste, premium stuff, amazon doesn't sell :(, hint to amazon, stock it, but you can get it at [...], its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand, the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy, a huge difference, i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal, very bland, boring by comparison, also as a side note, these are very small containers, i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store, these are like 1/4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally.","I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side. One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.  We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.  Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.  We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock. These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.","Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.  Still not going to blow your head off, maybe Melinda needs to come out with a XXXXXXXXXXXtra Hot version of this stuff, but you'll still have a hard time finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken.  Still not as universal as Tabasco Habanero, but a great complement to veggies and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect. Great stuff, a staple for any decent collection. BTW, if you like the flavor of this stuff and still crave more heat, check out Iguana Radioactive Atomic Sauce, its got the same basic ingredients as Melinda's, the same consistency, but is about 6X up the heat scale from this relatively weak XXXX sauce. 5 Scovies","I have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them.  I was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon, although that is a lot of chips!  I ordered one plain and one spicy.  The plain were delicious and fresh.  The spicy were stale.  So now I have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips...thus the gamble with ordering in quantity I suppose.  The chips themselves are wonderful, nutty and a much healthier and lower carb/higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips.  I eat them plain, with salsa or make nachos with them.  We even crumble them over taco salad.","I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!"
4,"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!  Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.","This is one of the best tasting waters that I've tried. It is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it. It is enhanced with minerals and honestly, I can taste the mineral taste which I like. Funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume. Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.  I really liked it and gave it to my family too. They were surprised with a yum which isn't really a reaction that I normally get from water.  It has 9.5 pH factor and infused with electrolytes. Can't really tell those things from drinking it but good to know. Recommending completely on taste. It's excellent tasting water.","I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,","This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the brand Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the ""masala"" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.  As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!","I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and ""crisp"".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something ""good"" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day.","I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water. I can actually taste the difference at restaurants when they serve tap water versus purified or bottled water. Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the best water I have ever tasted. It tastes completely clear and delicious.  I only received a 1.5 liter bottle, so I did not notice any of the medical benefits of the 9.5pH water. I do have GERD, but didn't notice a difference with drinking the 1.5 liters of water over 2 days. The price is a little steep on this water, but I would consider buying more for the taste and to see if it really helps my GERD.","This offers a quick way for a tasty drink. Fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola - peach tea! Yeah, not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good. They say 24 uses but I probably got only 15 or so since I either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses.  The current price on Amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle. I think that is pretty steep but I would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors.","It's light and refreshing.  I've tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut.  The Western coconuts like the ones from the Caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the Far East like Indonesia.  So, comparing this to the Western coconut water, it's way better and much more refreshing.  Comparing this to the Indonesian coconut water, it's below par.  All in all, it's still pretty good.","I've had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products, so I was hoping for something better with the MiO Sweet Tea.  At first I got the mixture wrong-- I put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water.  There was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong.  Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  The flavor is great, and I love it!  The 24 servings of this product were gone in no time, as I made 16 ounce servings frequently.  I imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing, so be careful as you squirt it out, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending this.","I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because ""rain forest"" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey."
5,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.  A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.  All in all, this is still a decent option for days when you know you're going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would-be fridge thieves.","When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.   My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs of the tender beef spinach. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too? For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.","When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.

I loved that it has wholesome ingredients, and that ""meat"" is the first ingredient on the list.  Look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you'll see that meat isn't first or second, and then when you find it you'll find it only contains ""meat by-products.""  My pets have had a healthy coat & firm stools eating this brand of dog food, and you can't beat the price.  The added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food.  I will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well.","I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.  Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.",We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,"I had never purchased Beef Jerky or Beef Sticks through an on line vendor, prior to placing an order with Choo Choo R. Snacks. The products arrived on time and in good shape.  They were great. The peperoni sticks lasted about 4 days.  The big bag of jerky, about 6.  I had heard several customers complain about the jerky being tough.  When I was growing up, some 50 yearsw ago, jerked meat WAS TOUGH, chewy, but tough.  Bufflo Bills' Hickory smoked jerky was delicious.  They sent along a packof Teriaki (SP), flavored jerky.  Wow, that was soooo good!  I have placed another order with Choo Choo R Snacks.  I will buy all my Jerky, Beef Sticks, etc from Choo Choo.  They do these products right!",The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,"Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.  However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.  Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.","I have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years, so no matter how often I get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile. Although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that I have tried, it is still a little over-powering for my taste.  My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.  But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.  I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.  I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower, my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.  After drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky, somewhat shiny and was quite  easy to manage."
6,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.  The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!  I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!","As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)","We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.","This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!  She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at:  Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)   Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.  In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.  Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff:  Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)   (Did they really want me to post a video with this review? Would you? Then its unanimous, this review will remain video-free!)","I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.  TRY THIS INSTEAD:  Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag","I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) ""Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food."" Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.  update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.  5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track.","With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.  Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.","I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!","Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""  So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.  We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)  It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).  Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.","I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!"
