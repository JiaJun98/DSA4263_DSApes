breakfast_tea,"I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.",0
breakfast_tea,"Not only is this tea delicious, but it's organic and very cheap! I've bought Rooibos from over 5 other stores, and it has never been this cheap or this good! Davidson's for the win",1
breakfast_tea,"I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.  It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed. This was, for me, a complete waste of my time and money.  I paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it didn't do a bit of good.  Very disappointing.",0
breakfast_tea,"I love the flavor of this tea, even though it is decaffeinated, it is one of the few decaf teas that still have a good robust taste.  This and the Irish Breakfast (Decaf) are among my favorites.",1
breakfast_tea,"Have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible.  The only ""bad"" thing I can say about it is that it can be a little addictive :)  Follow up: We usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends (half-nhalf - what's that??).  The other day we were out so I used the Santini condensed milk instead.  All I can say is, wow!  Actually enjoyed it more than cream - and then I compared the labels.  The condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream.  We're never going back!",1
breakfast_tea,"I am already a fan/buyer of Lipton's herbal tea, having tried the  Island Mango & Peach ,  the Mandarin Orange  and  Blueberry Pomegranate .  I like the fact that the ingredients are natural - hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry. It's definitely 'herbal' tea - there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients (which is why it's caffeine free).  I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)  I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.  Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea.",1
breakfast_tea,"My only complaint is that on the bottom of the package, the expiration date is 2001.  I don't think that's correct.  I made several cups of tea before I noticed it, and figured that since I hadn't had any adverse effects, either it was incorrect or it didn't matter.  It tastes refreshing and smells great! The combination of coconut and green tea is awesome!",1
breakfast_tea,This adds something special to a regular burger and fries.  My husband loves spicy foods and he loves the kick that this gives him.,1
