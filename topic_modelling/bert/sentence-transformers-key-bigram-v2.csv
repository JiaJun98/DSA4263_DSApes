"Little lesson on TRUFFLES... Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.  Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.  Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",Outliers
"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting.",Outliers
Kona tastes just as great as always. I'm so glad to find a site that I can buy from and not be burned.,Outliers
The stuff takes a lot of stirring to get it dissolved.Then drink it quickly before it starts to settle on the bottom.,Outliers
"I've just gone through my first box of this beef jerky, and it tastes really good.  My whole family likes it.  It's spicy, but not unbearable.  The sweetness tend to balance out the spiciness.  The only problem I had with my first order was that one of the bags was moldy.  Must be faulty packaging.",Outliers
"This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.   We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.   I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).  Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended.",Outliers
"Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!! Genisoy Soy Crisps, Deep Sea Salted, 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",Outliers
"I am very careful these days what I eat due to a recent diagnosis. One of the things I watch is MSG - read some reports on it and you'll understand why. Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, ""Will it taste good?"". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!",Outliers
These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!,Outliers
I use this powder to make the Jamba Juice equivalent of the Matcha Green Tea Blast. It does a great job in reproducing the taste. I'd recommend this supplier!,Outliers
