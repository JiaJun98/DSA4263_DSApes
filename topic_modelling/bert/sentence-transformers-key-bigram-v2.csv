"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad.",Outliers
I have bought this at a local pet shop for my koi. The fish do well on this product and I just found it is also sold through Amazon for about 30% less.,Outliers
"I can only drink decaf.  Caffiene makes me nuts.  Most decaf teas are flat taste-wise.  This one has a rich, distinct flavor.  I highly recommend it.",Outliers
"I bought this product last week for our dogs, within a day both were vomiting and refusing food. Our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not. Taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats.",Outliers
"I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.",Outliers
I bought this product from vitacost.  I really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor.  I decided to purchse from Amazon because it's in bulk thereore cheaper.  It'sso worht it. I've tried a lot.  This mix really impressed me.  No chocolate to melt in the car.,Outliers
"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.",Outliers
Great taste. Candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter. Wrapper sticks to candy. Other than that the candy is perfect.,Outliers
"You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.  This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.  I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.  Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots.",Outliers
This brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy.  I didn't have jitters afterwards and I noticed a difference in focus.  I have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects.,Outliers
This is one of my absolute favorites. Would recommend to anyone. I have even gotten coworkers hooked on it because it is so good.,Soft Drinks
"This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn't right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up & sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isn't good for you!!  I'm sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re-ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not.",Soft Drinks
This is a great tasting product. It doesn't have any sugar. It flows just like honey!,Soft Drinks
"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.  The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.  My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:  RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99  Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.  I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.",Soft Drinks
"These are really tasty. Wish I could read Chinese to get an idea of the nutritional information, including sodium and calories.",Soft Drinks

"Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets.",Soft Drinks
"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.  All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.  I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.",Soft Drinks
"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.  The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)",Soft Drinks
"Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.",Tea/Coffee
"I hope I don't offend but I am not a regular visitor to Starbucks.  It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a ""chain restaurant"" brand, it is actually pretty good.",Tea/Coffee

Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...,Tea/Coffee
"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted ""off"" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet.",Tea/Coffee

A certainly refreshing bottle of water and a very large one at that. The taste is very pleasing without the plastic from the bottle taste to taint it. It seems a bit pricey though giving you extra benefits might just be worth the purchase.,Tea/Coffee
"I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the ""base"", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.  As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.  I will try a different brand next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!",Tea/Coffee
"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",Dog Food
This was gross. It lamb lund & smelled bad. There hard chips. My dogs Favorite is the Texas Taffy. Thats a winner. I cut it into peices. she LOVES THEM.,Dog Food
"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.  I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.",Dog Food
"I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".  Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.  Do NOT trust this product!!!",Dog Food

"A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.",Dog Food
"I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn't realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date.",Dog Food
"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.  However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.  Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?",Dog Food
"This condiment ROCKS! Tasty, spicy and hot.  Loving it.  Just ordered the 4-pack.  Has won a long time customer.  I put this chili oil on Raman noodles with pork and green onion, a little ginger and a little hoisin and fish sauce and you got yourself a delicious meal. 5 STAR for sure!!!",Sauces

"This is the best ham base (they also make excellent chicken, beef, mushroom, and veggie base) I have ever used. It works great for ham gravy and ham soup. It enhances ham flavor in many ham dishes, too. Made with natural ham pieces and NO MSG. A little goes a long way for making gravy. Highly recommended for ham lovers.",Sauces

"Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.  Still not going to blow your head off, maybe Melinda needs to come out with a XXXXXXXXXXXtra Hot version of this stuff, but you'll still have a hard time finding any other habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken.  Still not as universal as Tabasco Habanero, but a great complement to veggies and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect. Great stuff, a staple for any decent collection. BTW, if you like the flavor of this stuff and still crave more heat, check out Iguana Radioactive Atomic Sauce, its got the same basic ingredients as Melinda's, the same consistency, but is about 6X up the heat scale from this relatively weak XXXX sauce. 5 Scovies",Sauces

"I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour.",Baking Products

I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.

"After doing some of research, both taste testing and strictly from a nutritional standpoint, these Kashi Golean bars in Chocolate/Caramel seemed to rise to the top of my list.  There were definitely some bars that offered more protein or fiber or even less calories or fat, but overall this seemed to be the best all around for me.  It comes in with 150 calories(less than most of competitors), 3 grams of fat(less than a lot of competitors), 8 grams of protein(more/on par with many of its competitors), and 6 grams of fiber(more than a lot of competitors). Oh yeah, and they taste pretty awesome as well.",Snack Bars
"Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.  You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.  Perfect in every way, and organic!  The only ""con"" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).  The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.  If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.  These things are AMAZING",Snack Bars

I bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and (I had to check the ingredients) soy crisps inside! I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar. I still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do!",Snack Bars

"I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!",Chips
"I have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them.  I was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon, although that is a lot of chips!  I ordered one plain and one spicy.  The plain were delicious and fresh.  The spicy were stale.  So now I have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips...thus the gamble with ordering in quantity I suppose.  The chips themselves are wonderful, nutty and a much healthier and lower carb/higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips.  I eat them plain, with salsa or make nachos with them.  We even crumble them over taco salad.",Chips

I was so hoping that Starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups. Starbucks has exceeded my hopes. This coffee is delicious. THANKS STARBUCKS,Keurig Coffee Products
"I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.",Keurig Coffee Products

Organic and gluten free, at about $3 per 10oz box it may not be for everyone, but for those who need to worry about gluten, this cereal is definitely not a trade-off on taste.

Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.  update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product.

Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him.

I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",Popcorn

"I have tried a few brands of truffle salt.  I like it on popcorn.  I thought that this product would be great since it was 10% truffle instead of the 5% I had been purchasing.  Although the aroma of this product is good, the taste is just bad--not awful, bad.  The bitter flavor is at the front, not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor.  I am very disappointed.",Popcorn

"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again.",Popcorn

"I found this product at a little tiny store. I bought it figuring what the heck. My hair is damaged and a little bit fried. this product gave me shine, it calmed most of my frizzies, and a wonderful subtle scent to go with it. i love this product...the only down side is its a little bit hard to find.",Oil Products
I love this coconut oil. It adds a great coconut flavor to baked goods. I love the coconut smell when I use it as lotion or hair conditioner. Tastes good and so healthy for you too! Good bargain when you get free shipping through Amazon.,Oil Products
"This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go-to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it's omega-3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it's made in California!  Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store.",Oil Products
"LOVE this stuff! Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face. I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too.",Oil Products
"The soup is very tasty. I add flavor with dried parsley flakes, celery seed and lots of pepper. This is the second time I've received a shipment of Campbells's Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle soup. I am reluctant to order it again since almost every can was dented in the last batch. That said, I wish Amazon carried the Homestyle chicken noodle soup. I like that better as the noodles are smaller and firmer.",Soup
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",Soup
"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont.",Soup

"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.",Soup

"A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.  Gary Peterson",Soup

"compared to other egg proteins I have recently used, this one is very sweet.  It is sweetened with splenda, so still very low in actual sugar/carbs.  I prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it, but my wife likes this one b/c its easy to instantize in milk (we use almond milk) with a spoon.  No blender required.",Protein Powder
I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!,Protein Powder
"I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.",Protein Powder

"I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!  Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other.",Protein Powder

"I like this protein powder. On its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than I should have at one time, so I mix one scoop of it with a scoop of EAS 100% whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me. I use this product daily.",Protein Powder
"I have been taking this for many years and love it.  The taste isn't bad at all, though, if you are used to having your Protein Drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener, you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a McDonald's Milk Shake.  But the taste is fine.  It is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product, as in addition to 26 grams of vegan protein, it is loaded with other healthful nutrients.  Each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it, plus a vitamin complex, and enzymes.  If you are looking for a really excellent Vegan Protein this is the ticket, plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi-vitamin.",Protein Powder
"I don't usually like protein drinks  I DO love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix  This fits the bill perfectly - plus it's good for me :)  I find the vanilla flavor very nice, the texture not very chalky, and the amount in the canister perfect!  I mix with milk - never tried water - it might not be as tasty that way...",Protein Powder
"So far have tried two flavors, this and oat & raisins and prefer the other better. This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.  As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.  I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars.",Protein Powder
We really like this peanut butter. The taste is great as my kids do not eat the completely natural peanut butter with only peanuts and salt. I don't care for it much either. This is a nice in-between that I feel is pretty healthy. We get this auto-shipped by Amazon for convenience and price. We go through a lot of PBJs for 3 kids' school lunches and I eat quite a few of them too!,Peanut Butter
"Absolutely the best Nutella alternative. I actually prefer it over nutella, it tastes so rich and just plain phenomenal! A bit more hazelnutty than Nutella, gah just great!",Peanut Butter
"It really does taste good!  I don't like to measure anything... So if you put in too much water, you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker.  Though, if you don't like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind, this might not be for you.",Peanut Butter
"I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all).",Peanut Butter
Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!,Peanut Butter
"I really enjoy this peanut butter, it is sweet and a treat. It is not entirely smooth, it has a slight granule texture. Maybe because of the honey mixed in. Otherwise it is one less jar to grab, if you like honey and peanut butter.",Peanut Butter
