"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad.",Outliers

"I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.",Outliers
I bought this product from vitacost.  I really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor.  I decided to purchse from Amazon because it's in bulk thereore cheaper.  It'sso worht it. I've tried a lot.  This mix really impressed me.  No chocolate to melt in the car.,Outliers
"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.",Outliers
Great taste. Candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter. Wrapper sticks to candy. Other than that the candy is perfect.,Outliers
"You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.  This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.  I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.  Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots.",Outliers
This brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy.  I didn't have jitters afterwards and I noticed a difference in focus.  I have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects.,Outliers
"This little can packs a good punch!  Lots of flavor and a caffeine boost.  Apparently, all for just 100 calories (according to the can).  The flavor is very rich but not so rich that you can't finish it.  I drank it right from the can, as I probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can.  I poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent.  So if this is going to be your ""on the road"" solution, you might think again.  But, if you can enjoy it in a glass -- you won't be disappointed.  Good stuff!",Soft Drinks
"My kids love this white cheddar snack, but it isn't always easy to find in our shopping area. This wasn't cheap, but we are happy that we can order Pirate Booty through Amazon. The 1 oz. bags are the perfect size for their school lunches. The taste is cheesy and light...love 'em.",Soft Drinks

I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now don't even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but it's not available.  Very Disappointed  Leona  The order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.

"My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.  It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts.",Tea/Coffee
"To be fair, I have not tried this in my drip coffee maker, only the Bialetti Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Percolator.  The flavor is strong but smooth.  It's not as bitter/acidic as Starbucks (and I like Starbucks alot).  Definitely recommend for the Bialetti.  P.S. The tins are nice too. Great for re-use around the house.",Tea/Coffee
I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve,Tea/Coffee

I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended.,Tea/Coffee
"This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.  So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!  This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.",Tea/Coffee
"If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.",Tea/Coffee

"rye oats wheat rice and barley are not part of a dogs evolutionaly history so why feed unnatural foods. Dogs are carnivors. Green Cow is a good value and will extend your pets healthy life. i started feeding green cow to my 13 year old Golden 18 months ago. this is my 7th golden and number 8 will get tripe from the start. also it should be noted that she gets 45 minutes of hard exercise daily. dont let age slow your pet down. if you have an older large dog with hind leg and back arthritis you may want to try Pyhcox, I double the recommended dose. my observation is these 2 products have decreased my pets pain and stiffness increased her muscle mass and improved her daily life.",Dog Food
"This is a quality product that my dog adores.  I like it because I can make a little or a lot.  We use this to supplement kibble as she is not on a raw diet.  I used to make food or use a high quality can food, but find the Addiction to be a lot more convenient.  Besides that, I don't like the smell of can food.  This comes in plastic bags that you cannot reseal, so be prepared to transfer to an airtight container.",Dog Food
Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this brand! I tried another and they refused to eat them!

"No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!  July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.  The canned food is great, too.  September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.",Dog Food
"A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.",Dog Food

"Once we tried this fabulous spice mix for beef fajitas, we were hooked.  we use this spice mix everytime we prepare fajitas on both chicken and beef.  It is not too spicy so if you like real heat, you might want to add some cayenne pepper.  It is just right for us and allows the beefy flavor of the skirt steak to come through. It also does chicken proud.  We serve them on fresh flour tortillas.",Sauces

"We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!",Sauces
"Tried this, per package directions adding smoked sausage and cut up chicken tenders. Wow, was it ever good. I liked it so much that I immediately came back for another case in the event that this product might be out in the future. If you are a fan of Jambalya you will love this. Spicy but not overpowering. Made a HUGE amount. Three of us had dinner with grandson going back for seconds and there was still plenty for the next day for lunch. What is so great about this is that you can add anything you want to it and it would be great or fix it as is and still be happy! Try it!",Sauces

"I've never had quinoa but I've read and heard enough about it to finally give in and order some.  This is a lot cheaper than what you would find at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and it's delicious (not to mention great for you).  If you're just getting into Quinoa just search for some recipes on Google - try the quinoa and black bean recipe, it's awesome.  As far as the product goes, it's very neatly packaged and prewashed, so you don't need to rinse it.  The pouches are easy to open and close and that's good because you probably won't use all 16 ounces in one sitting.  The red qunioa looks great in salads, with cereal, or on it's own!",Sauces
"Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough.",Baking Products

"I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it.",Baking Products
"This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The ""mouth feel"" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.",Baking Products
"I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten-eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense. If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag. In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing.",Baking Products
"I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product.",Baking Products
"I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.

"If you are looking for a tasty snack, look no further.  These caramel Fiber One bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar.  The consistency is chewy, but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth.  Since each bar provides 35% of daily recommended fiber, it's relatively healthy as well.  For those individuals that are on Weight Watchers, these bars are 2 points each... and well worth it.  I highly recommend this snack.  I also recommend the peanut butter Fiber One bars, although they are not quite as tasty, in my opinion.   Fiber One Bars Oats And Peanut Butter, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)",Snack Bars
"These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!",Snack Bars

"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.  Gary Peterson",Snack Bars
At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.,Snack Bars

This pack contains everything needed for a quick and healthy pasta lunch.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  The straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta.  This mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta, drain it and add the sauce.  However, the trade off of more time for preparation is outweighed by having an option that can be stored on a shelf or in a desk drawer.  A nice option for work or on the go!",Noodle

"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of ""sensitive skin"" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.",Salty Food Products
"I switched to Celtic sea salt for added minerals, and also because the body can process it better than table salt. The taste is unbelieveable!! It highlights every flavor of your food! I am so impressed I refuse to go back to table salt for any reason! It is damp, due to being taken directly from a sea bed. Althoug I did not get the grinder the company offers, instead I got one at Target. It works ok, I do have to shake the grinder sometimes to get it to work freely with the damp salt. Overall, I am extermely impressed with this salt.",Salty Food Products
"Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.",Salty Food Products
"These vegetable flavored crackers are a pleasant surprise for those of us who are gluten sensitive.  They have an almost pizza-like fragrance and taste very nice indeed. As a veteran of sampling rice crackers, cakes, etc., as well as crackers of other grains, I must say this Glutino texture is much preferable to the hard crackle rice flour gives to crackers and, too, the flavor is quite good. I have subscribed to have them delivered as a result.",Crackers
"Although it is a bit alarming to have these given a 5 star review by a cheesewhiz afficianado, (a condiment competing for most vile non-food item on the supermarket shelf imo), these actually are really fabulous. They have a mealy texture and great oaty/oily taste that is better than any other oat cake I have tried, and better than any other cracker too. My babies also love them and as non wheat products are suitable for the young and for the allergic.",Crackers
"I just ordered 5 boxes of Solbites to give to my customers at Fiat of Montgomeryville.  Within a week the supply was depleted.  Great packaging, great taste, great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks.  Solbites gets five stars from Fiat of Montgomeryville.  Look for our next order!",Crackers
"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.  First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.  FYI Nutrition info: Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box Calories 140 Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat Cholesterol 0 Total Carbs 18g Fiber 2g Sugars 0 Protein 2g Sodium 50g  BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people. Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.  Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.  Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!",Crackers
"These work great with s'mores - I was so shocked. They are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams, but I found that refreshing. Because they are thicker, they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams, which can fall apart. I'd highly recommend!",Crackers
"I had these crackers in a snack box on a recent Delta flight and enjoyed them so much I searched the internet to see where I could purchase them locally.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a store in my area that sold them.  The taste is so good you can eat them just as a snack or serve with dips or spreads.  I ordered the Roasted Garlic with Rosemay and also the onion flavored version (which I haven't tried, yet).  Although some reviewers said their Wisecrackers showed up in bits and pieces, mine were in perfect shape.",Crackers
"We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a ""normal"" cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights.",Crackers
"Looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won't go straight to your waistline? These paper thin - beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any/all of your favorite toppings.

At 120 calories for 19 crackers (0 calories from fat) these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you'll feel great about eating them. I initially found these in a ""Health Food Store"" but Amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money. Quality was as good or better. Well... that's what I think. Oh, and YUM!",Crackers
"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!",Cat Food
"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",Cat Food
"I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)  One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.  The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.",Cat Food
I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.,Cat Food
"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it.",Cat Food
"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.",Cat Food
"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",Cat Food
"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.",Cat Food
"This is the most expensive coconut juice I have ever purchased.  For some reason, I thought it would taste more natural and refreshing than Goya or Foco, which tastes more sweet than natural.

"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.",Coconut Products
"It's light and refreshing.  I've tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut.  The Western coconuts like the ones from the Caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the Far East like Indonesia.  So, comparing this to the Western coconut water, it's way better and much more refreshing.  Comparing this to the Indonesian coconut water, it's below par.  All in all, it's still pretty good.",Coconut Products
"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!  I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.  I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.  To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category.",Coconut Products
"this adds a great taste to your popcorn, its not easy to get the same measurement each time and removing it from the container provided is a bit of a task. The price of this product is high, and even higher depending on your location(shipping costs are very high and are on the rise). this product does not yield as much popped corn as some other products. But it still is the best for Taste, gives a great flavor from the initial popping and not adding any toppings.",Popcorn
We use this popcorn in an air popper on the weekends. It is delicious and tastes much better than anything we have been able to find in the stores.,Popcorn

I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he.",Popcorn
"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again.",Popcorn
Received this set as a gift and they are a wonderful tasting product.  Perfect for my West Bend popcorn maker.,Popcorn
"Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",Popcorn
Great coconut oil! Purchased this to use when making my own popcorn & it is great.  My whole family loves the taste.  After buying this I read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn & was thrilled to get it & see that it is virgin coconut oil.  Love it!  Hope it comes in a larger container for next time!,Popcorn
"I have tried a few brands of truffle salt.  I like it on popcorn.  I thought that this product would be great since it was 10% truffle instead of the 5% I had been purchasing.  Although the aroma of this product is good, the taste is just bad--not awful, bad.  The bitter flavor is at the front, not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor.  I am very disappointed.",Popcorn

"LOVE this stuff! Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face. I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too.",Oil Products
"This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go-to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it's omega-3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it's made in California!  Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store.",Oil Products
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",Soup
"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.",Soup
"For a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water.,,,nothing can beat Dr. McDougall's Split Pea Soup with Barley. This is the best ""instant soup"" that is on the market.",Soup

Since I have to watch my sodium I have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile.  Campbell's made one but no longer does.  If you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better.,Soup
"I didn't like the taste of this very much.  It was OK, but it tasted a little odd.  I loved their White Lightening Chicken Chili, but don't recommended the Chicken Noodle Soup.",Soup
"Tried this and the Chicken, neither left a pleasant taste at all. They were bitter and just not good for a soup base.",Soup

I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!,Protein Powder
"I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!  Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other.",Protein Powder
I ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy. I didnt. I have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it. It taste like dirt and grass. Not s very good product.,Protein Powder
"This protein powder is absolutely delicious! It blends well with no clumps, chunks, or residue. It has a wonderful taste that I recognize from smoothies I've had at ""real"" smoothie bars. My homemade smoothies now taste like I bought them from a shop! I only wish I had bought the 28 oz bags instead of the 14 oz bags. Will definitely correct that for next time!",Protein Powder

"We like to make Smoothies in our home. Throw a little yogurt, some milk, some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm. But sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit. Or sometimes we want a fruit that isn't in season. That is where this smoothie mix comes in.  You put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie. W e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor. Out of the two, we prefer this peach. It has a great flavor and mixes up well.  In addition to using this for smoothies, we also use this when we make ice cream.  This is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack.  Enjoy.",Protein Powder
"So far have tried two flavors, this and oat & raisins and prefer the other better. This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.  As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.  I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars.",Protein Powder
"I don't usually like protein drinks  I DO love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix  This fits the bill perfectly - plus it's good for me :)  I find the vanilla flavor very nice, the texture not very chalky, and the amount in the canister perfect!  I mix with milk - never tried water - it might not be as tasty that way...",Protein Powder
"Absolutely the best Nutella alternative. I actually prefer it over nutella, it tastes so rich and just plain phenomenal! A bit more hazelnutty than Nutella, gah just great!",Peanut Butter
"This is an excellent soy free alternative to peanut butter. I even bake with it.  I make ""peanut"" butter cookies that people would swear are real peanut butter with this product.  It's definitely not a ""No-Stir"" product though.  It does arrive separated.  The oil tends to rise to the top and so it does need to be stirred from time to time.  This is still a fabulous product.  My children adore it.",Peanut Butter
"I really enjoy this peanut butter, it is sweet and a treat. It is not entirely smooth, it has a slight granule texture. Maybe because of the honey mixed in. Otherwise it is one less jar to grab, if you like honey and peanut butter.",Peanut Butter
I could eat this right out of the jar.  I am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter I use in my smoothies.  It is alot less messy and tastes delicious.  Even my husband is surprised. Luv it!,Peanut Butter
"This product tastes just like peanut butter, so a great alternative for those with a peanut allergy or for children who attend ""peanut free"" schools.  My granddaughter could not taste the difference.  We all use this product now and love it.",Peanut Butter
"I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all).",Peanut Butter
Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!,Peanut Butter
The peanut butter was very fresh tasting.  The peanut chunks just as advertised were big.  The price was great.  The shipping was fast.  Lot easier to order on line than go to the store.,Peanut Butter
