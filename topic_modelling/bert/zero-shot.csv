"We decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house!  This was our first purchase of syrup, and we are so pleased with the quality.  It tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past.  The banana is delish, and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far!  Wonderful product!",Outliers,Y,0.744444444
"This is the best salad dressing I've ever had. It really does taste like bruschetta, and since it's oil-based instead of cream, it's way healthier. Five stars!",Outliers,Y,0.255555556
"I am very careful these days what I eat due to a recent diagnosis. One of the things I watch is MSG - read some reports on it and you'll understand why. Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, ""Will it taste good?"". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and onion flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!",Outliers,Y,
"These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didn't really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up.",Outliers,Y,
"I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, it's impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!!",Outliers,Y,
"For an all natural diet drink, this is amazing. It has a better taste then most other Rootbeers that are found in stores and is better for you! I originally didn't realize this was diet when I bought it, but I don't mind at all! It is actually much better in my opinion then the non-diet version, but its up to you!  Note: This is really only a good deal if you get free shipping through Amazon Prime, because when these are on sale in stores, they cost about the same (give or take $1-$3)",Outliers,N,
"It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too.",Outliers,Y,
"I think this is new on the market and got a free sample.  It tastes delicious like Pina Colada but not too sweet/heavy, low-cal and uses sucralose (aka Splenda) which is closer to natural sugar and supposedly better for you then aspartame (NutraSweet), (would be even better with stevia).  But at $2.50 a pop, that's $75 to get your Vitamin D each month.  Still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend, this is one of the better ones I've run across.  If I could get it for under $2 a pop, I could get hooked on it. These guys are obviously competing with the likes of Vitamin Water which comes in 20 oz bottles instead of 14.5 and can be had for cheaper.  Interesting bottle shape though.  They'll have to probably drop the price or say bye bye, at least in this economy.",Outliers,N,
"My wife doesn't like chocolate, but she likes granola. I love chocolate and I'm fine with granola. Here's a granola snack we can agree on. She tasted it and pronounced it ""pretty good."" I'm a big fan of chocolate bars with add-ins, like bacon or fruit or chili, so chocolate with berries is right up my alley. I like it, and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it. Now if I can just get our 5-year-old to try some, I can share the whole family's opinion.",Outliers,N,
"The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much ""an English thing"" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in ""Victoria Beckham is Marmite"" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!",Outliers,N,
The chocolate PB2 is just as amazing as the regular PB2 - plus a healthy indulgence. I love to use it as a dip for animal crackers! Also great on apple wedges.,Drinks,N,
"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.",Drinks,Y,
This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.,Drinks,Y,
"These seemed like a great idea. I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.  If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.  (I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.)",Drinks,Y,
"This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice.",Drinks,Y,
This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.,Drinks,Y,
"This honey tastes great, plus the fact that it is raw, and research indicates it may be useful in the healing of stomach ulcers is a bonus.",Drinks,N,
"This is the most expensive coconut juice I have ever purchased.  For some reason, I thought it would taste more natural and refreshing than Goya or Foco, which tastes more sweet than natural.  Nope, I was wrong.  It tastes exactly the same as the others, and has the same exact ingredients from Thailand.",Drinks,Y,
This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price.,Drinks,Y,
"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.  I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.  Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic¬Æ has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.  The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?  I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.  I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad.",Drinks,Y,
Great tasting pecans though it would be great if they were larger.  Packing would have been better in boxes instead cos quite a few were turned to pecan dust.  I would buy again though since they are really good to eat as a snack or cereal topping.,Snacks,Y,
"These are one of the best tasting potato chips that I have tasted. Nice and crunchy, a little thicker than other chips, and just the right amount of salt.  While these are certainly not a health food, the current packaging boasts that they have 40% less fat than regular chips. The package also boasts ""no artificial flavors, no preservatives, no MSG, no trans fats, made with all-natural ptotatoes and seasonings."" One serving has: 6g fat, of which only 1g is saturated fat; 135mg sodium; 1g sugar, and 2g protein. For potato chips that is pretty good.  Shop for price. The printed price on a 8.5 oz bag is $3.49, and I can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket.",Snacks,Y,
"This is by far the best deal going for Oh Henry! bars that I've found anywhere, either online or in retail stores.  An entire 36-pack for under $20 is truly a great bargain, and I found the quality and freshness of the bars to be quite good.  Very satisfied with the purchase, and I will be re-ordering when this box has been devoured!",Snacks,Y,
I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.,Snacks,Y,
"These snacks are SO fresh and tasty, I have never had any snacks that are fresher than these.  After trying the first bag of Mareblue snacks, they became our favorites for everyone in the family.  They are not very sweet, but just right for our taste.  Thank Goodness for Mareblue!  Now we have a great snack that is healthy and tasty.",Snacks,Y,
They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess it's so they don't stick together. Never again,Snacks,N,
"I'm very picky when it comes to chips. I've gone through so many, but this one really hits the spot. It has just the right amount of crunch, with just the right amount of flavor. It's also great to know that you're not eating something that's bad for you. With 100 calories a pack, it's definitely the ideal snack!",Snacks,Y,
These are great snacks for my kids and my teenagers even like them.  Better for them than high preservative and/or high calorie snacks and they give them some good carbs and protein.,Snacks,Y,
"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.  However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.  Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?",Snacks,N,
Shame on you! These are great mixers and the 5-packs are on sale at Target for just under 8 bucks each!,Snacks,N,
"I love these bars. The nuts with white chocolate are also great; not too much white chocolate so it's perfect. The creamy peanut butter is so good. It tastes great, smooth inside, and filling.  My kids love these too!",Healthy Alternatives,N,
"I like cashews any way, so I'm biased.  I really enjoyed these.  They do earn the name of salty, though.  So this product is not for those that need to eat low sodium, but for the rest of us they will be a tasty treat.",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
"This is a very nice hot cereal. The five grains give it a somewhat nutty flavor and a more complex texture than regular oatmeal, and it's quick to cook on the stove at only about 6 minutes. I like adding Wyman's frozen blueberries and strawberries (I add those when the oatmeal is done cooking but the heat is still on, so the frozen fruit can thaw a bit) as well as a bit of maple syrup and milk. mmm mm mm.",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
These bars are great for a snack. They have alot of healthy ingredients and low sugar. The bars have a good flavor from the coconut. It is hard to find bars that don't have soy ingredients as well.,Healthy Alternatives,Y,
"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.  Gary Peterson",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
"This product is great for people on who eat plant-based, whole foods.  There is no sugar added.  The product tastes delicious.  The price, however, is quite expensive for the size of the jar.  I found a similar product at a local whole-foods grocery store for half the price.",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
"I usually drink the regular Caffe D""Vita but I am on a low carb diet with no sugar so I thought I would try the sugar free. I couldn't find it in the stores so I bought a six pack can through the internet. It has absolutly no taste. Now I am stuck with six cans of sugar free Caffe D"" Vita and don't know what to do with them. I would not buy this product again.",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
"If you're into healthy living, you'll love this product - high in protein and fiber, sugar-free, all natural.  Just add milk and your favorite fruit and you have a tasty breakfast cereal.  Good for a snack too, although it can get messy if eaten dry.",Healthy Alternatives,Y,
Great product and the pricing on Amazon is pretty much impossible to beat.  You get about 3 bottles on amazon for the price of one at most places.  I use this syrup mostly for Lattes,Healthy Alternatives,N,
"Good quality Rose Petal Powder at a very good price!  I'm using it as a face and body scrub, as well as a mask.  It can be used alone, or it mixes well into argan oil or any liquid soaps and lotions.  Also highly recommend the vendor; the shipment was exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable time.",Healthy Alternatives,N,
"If you are ordering cookies, beware, the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :)",Carbohydrates,N,
You can buy this bread directly from Udi's for a lot cheaper. The Bread is great but not at this price.,Carbohydrates,Y,
"I discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it.  Went looking for it cheaper and found it here.  Was shocked by the 2 poor reviews.  Come on - you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi, with a very minimal ingredient/additive list.  Did you think it would taste as ""good"" as the versions loaded with white flour, sugar and oils?  The product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce I put over it.",Carbohydrates,Y,
For people who are Gluten sensitive this bread is a god send. It is easy to make with a bread maker and has a great taste.,Carbohydrates,Y,
"I just ordered 5 boxes of Solbites to give to my customers at Fiat of Montgomeryville.  Within a week the supply was depleted.  Great packaging, great taste, great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks.  Solbites gets five stars from Fiat of Montgomeryville.  Look for our next order!",Carbohydrates,Y,
For gluten free they are pretty good. They are a bit dry but that seems to be a problem with gluten free in general. I like the Simplebites line but I wish there were more varieties.,Carbohydrates,Y,
"my 9 yo daughter really loves this product. it's easy and quick to make, which makes it a convenient after school meal. it makes about 2 portions if you only eat noodles without adding chicken or tofu or veggies. but it's really tasty.",Carbohydrates,Y,
"I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter. So don't think gluten free means flavorless, this Bisquick Pancake Mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. It's so nice that these are healthier for you, diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too!",Carbohydrates,Y,
Armed with her recipe book and flour blend we are able to make fabulous gluten free food! The only bad thing is we make way more desserts than we should because they are just that good! Not only are they so good that you can't tell they are gluten free but they are better than anything I have ever made gluten or not! Delicious!!!!!!!,Carbohydrates,Y,
"What I liked about this product was first, the way it was packaged.  Inside there are several rows of thin cookies in a plastic tray.  You can grab to your heart's content.  When eaten, the cookie and the bits of fruit blend and make a great taste.  The only qualm is the package wire on the top.  It is not really easy to close and that may need to be redesigned.  But the product itself is tasty and I can't get enough of the bits of fruit.  What a good idea!",Carbohydrates,Y,
"This product is really good. My baby loves it every time!!! He can eat it by itself as breakfast, lunch or dinner! I also sometimes mix it with my homemade food when I need to improve its texture or flavor (too spicy, too lumpy e.t.c). Great healthy option no matter how you want to offer it to your baby or toddler.",Household,N,
Makes a lovely gift!  The flavor is is intoxicating and can be used for spicing up any kind of dish.,Household,N,
"Quality fruit, great texture not a brick! on the top of my reorder list! Highly recommend to all who love a lite fruit cake",Household,N,
"This was a great product and easy to use, I am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake, but after the second attempt I got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use. Everyone loved the cake that I made.",Household,N,
"According to my Labs, this tastes great.  It also lasts a long time against two chewers that get through most anything very quickly.",Household,N,
"This is an easy to make cake and it tastes really good. It is almost the same as the Coffee Cake I usually buy at Seattles Best Coffee House which is more than $2.00 a slice. It is really worth it for the price you paid. My family really loved it, we even eat it at breakfast.  I highly recommend this product, you can serve this on parties too, by using muffins pans. I usually use small bundt pans so my kids have their own individual cakes, they really love it!!!",Household,N,
"This is a really good product.  While it is only 4 ounces, it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots.  I have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking, and these are an excellent replacementwhen ""fresh"" is not required (such as salads, etc).  They save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking.  The product, while fairly costly (as are fresh shallots), is a real time saver, and worth every penny of the cost.  Freeze dried is much better than just plain dried.  I use freeze dried herbs whenever I can find them, as they more exactly replace fresh products.  If you use shallots, you will love this product.",Household,N,
"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.  The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)",Household,N,
"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.",Household,N,
"I must confess that I bought this product only because I wanted to see the pretty flower blossom inside the water. To my surprise, it smells and tastes really good too! And the flower is very pretty, totally worth it!",Household,Y,
It's so hard to find no sodium seasonings (other than Mrs. Dash) - this is a great product at a great price!,Sauce,Y,
"I've tried using this on chicken and hamburgers and really liked it. It's a nice change from ketchup and BBQ sauces. The Chipotle has a spicy tang but it's overwhelming. It's probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual Taco Bell restaurant. It actually has a slightly sweet taste. It is a bit salty and creamy for those who are health conscious, but I find that even a small bit provides a lot of flavor and can be spread quite far over your meal. The bottle seems a bit smaller than you might expect, but other than that I'd recommend this.",Sauce,Y,
"Very hot, but smooth, great consistancy, for use with most Korean cusine. Just a dab will do, you don't want too much. This items is tasty, but extremely hot. Great side with most Korean dishes",Sauce,Y,
"This is the greatest chocolate sauce I have ever tried.  It beats gourmet sauces, dairy sauces and any other form I have used in my life.  And the best part is that it is vegan and contains no nasty chemicals.  Its only problem is that it is seriously addicting to the basic chocoholic!",Sauce,Y,
"This is the next best thing to homemade chicken broth.  I've used this product to make soups, risotto and heighten the taste of gravy.  You may want to use a bit less water than is called for in the instructions",Sauce,Y,
If you are a chipotle lover you know its hard to find good chipotle spice.  This chipotle surprised we with great taste and yes its hot but not a burn your  tongue no taste hot.,Sauce,Y,
"This is a really good and easy recipe. You don't only get the spices, but you also get instructions on how to make this complex dish. I made it first with chicken and then I substituted it with tofu, both times rocked. For the price it's a really good buy.",Sauce,Y,
"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of ""sensitive skin"" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.",Sauce,N,
"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.  The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.",Sauce,Y,
"This is really just some good, clean tasting, hearty tomato sauce. The fact that it is organic is important to me, and it is also BPA free, so if you are concerned, dont be. Top notch product in my opinion, and one that i use at least twice a week in pasta and on pizzas.The s&s price in particular blows away normal grocer prices for this same can size.  Enjoy!",Sauce,Y,
"My dog hates this food, and through some research I have found that Science Diet is not very good quality. I have instead switched over to Orijen, a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog.",Dogs,Y,
"I have a puppy that absolutely loves them! She considers them her personal ""reward"" for everything she does. A good training aid.",Dogs,Y,
"I was very pleased when this arrived at the door - opened it immediately & dug in - wasn't till later when my wife got home & told me it was for the dog, not me.  Just kidding - our dog does like this Beneful, we get many compliments on her smooth coat, she's fit, full of fun & energy & very healthy. Dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet. Dogs do like variety too, Beneful has several different flavors, you may want to change it up every other bag or so. This 15.5 lb bag lasts about a month for our 50 lb Lab.  Sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn, tomatoes & other veggies, the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down. Other brands may be 'healthier' but are going to be more expensive. We selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine.",Dogs,Y,
"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",Dogs,Y,
These quickly became dog treats!  Just nasty!  I don't even know how they can sell these for human comsumption!  Stay away!,Dogs,Y,
"No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!  July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.  The canned food is great, too.  September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.",Dogs,Y,
"I use this treat as a reward for getting on the grooming table.  My three dogs ""line up"" when I pick up the grooming brush.  What a treat!",Dogs,Y,
"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",Dogs,Y,
"I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.",Dogs,Y,
This was gross. It lamb lund & smelled bad. There hard chips. My dogs Favorite is the Texas Taffy. Thats a winner. I cut it into peices. she LOVES THEM.,Dogs,Y,
"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!",Cats,Y,
"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",Cats,Y,
"I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)  One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.  The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.",Cats,Y,
I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.,Cats,Y,
"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it.",Cats,Y,
"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.",Cats,Y,
"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",Cats,Y,
"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.",Cats,Y,
"When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!",Cats,Y,
"cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!",Cats,Y,
