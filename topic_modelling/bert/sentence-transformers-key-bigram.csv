"Being from Europe, I absolutely love these... they taste great, and being sugar-free is an added bonus.  I understand why some Americans may not like these, as Americans in general prefer sweeter foods than Europeans, but if you're unsure I definitely recommend you try them.",Outliers
I received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box.  She stepped back and walked away without hesitating.  I smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it.  I checked the other 9 in the box and they all smelled the same...bad.  What a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them.  I won't be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats.,Outliers
"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!",Outliers
"In my opinion, the DHA soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy. Doesn't hurt that they are healthy, too! I usually drink Silk Brain & Bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work. I tried the ZenSoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised. It's very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk.",Outliers
These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!,Outliers

"These are great cacao nibs!  Wonderful in recipes!  I even substituted them for chocolate chips in  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread recipe I had.  It turned out very good!  These are also great chopped up in the food processor & used in raw food snacks.  I did have a problem with my first shipment from Amazon, one of the bags burst open due to their poor packing.  BUT Amazon sent me a new shipment for free so no complaints there!  Organic Pure Raw Cacao Nibs enjoyment the healthy way!",Outliers
"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars).",Outliers
I did not know I was a fan of soy milk! It taste great and I have one in the morning instead of cow's milk. It is also gluten free for all the Celiac's out there. No casein or lactose as well. I have already recommended this to friends.,Outliers
"My wife needs to eat GF.  We discovered this pasta brand and it has been great!  My 9 and 11 year old boys enjoy it as much as my wife does!  You can barley taste the difference between this pasta and the ""regular"" kind.  A must buy if you must eat GF.  Note, b/c of the expense for GF pasta (this brand), typically, I make two pasta ""bowls"", this brand for my wife and the non-GF for the three of us. With the exception of Baked Ziti and lazania.",Staple Food

"I got this product for consumption, I took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum, so glad I was able to find this product thru amazon, and after reading all the positive reviews I got it and started taking some with a glass of water, great product,fast delivery,great price, very happy with my purchase.",Staple Food
"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again.",Staple Food
"This was a great product and easy to use, I am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake, but after the second attempt I got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use. Everyone loved the cake that I made.",Staple Food

"Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack.",Staple Food
We have been getting these Crisps for some time now and we love them. I also ordered some for my granddaughter they make a great healthy treat for her and she loves them too.,Staple Food
"This is a very nice hot cereal. The five grains give it a somewhat nutty flavor and a more complex texture than regular oatmeal, and it's quick to cook on the stove at only about 6 minutes. I like adding Wyman's frozen blueberries and strawberries (I add those when the oatmeal is done cooking but the heat is still on, so the frozen fruit can thaw a bit) as well as a bit of maple syrup and milk. mmm mm mm.",Staple Food
"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.  HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.  I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.",Staple Food
"Bought this for my wife. We'd recently bought a Celestial Seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over-a-dollar-a-cup price tag. This was a much better buy and is now my wife's favorite K-Cup tea, regardless of price. I just wish Amazon would offer it as a subscription so we can shave off that fifteen percent!",Coffee

"I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him! Coffee Bean Direct, you need to do better, MUCH better...",Coffee
"The Switch is marketed as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't""...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors (""natural"" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.  The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.  The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill.",Coffee
"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.  Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.  I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!  While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.",Coffee
"I love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can.  I usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee & the first cup I had of this brew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one.  I then dropped the cup size down one notch, made a second cup and found what I was looking for.  Tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup & they did not compare to the rich aroma & fine taste that I'm now getting with Revv",Coffee

"We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a ""normal"" cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights.",Chips
"I have purchased these in the past from other websites and love them.  I was excited to find such a deal on the price per bag by purchasing the case through amazon, although that is a lot of chips!  I ordered one plain and one spicy.  The plain were delicious and fresh.  The spicy were stale.  So now I have a case of stale chips and a case of fresh chips...thus the gamble with ordering in quantity I suppose.  The chips themselves are wonderful, nutty and a much healthier and lower carb/higher fiber alternative to tortilla chips.  I eat them plain, with salsa or make nachos with them.  We even crumble them over taco salad.",Chips

"These work great with s'mores - I was so shocked. They are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams, but I found that refreshing. Because they are thicker, they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams, which can fall apart. I'd highly recommend!",Chips
"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",Dog Food
I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.,Dog Food
"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.  I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.",Dog Food

"I was very pleased when this arrived at the door - opened it immediately & dug in - wasn't till later when my wife got home & told me it was for the dog, not me.  Just kidding - our dog does like this Beneful, we get many compliments on her smooth coat, she's fit, full of fun & energy & very healthy. Dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet. Dogs do like variety too, Beneful has several different flavors, you may want to change it up every other bag or so. This 15.5 lb bag lasts about a month for our 50 lb Lab.  Sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn, tomatoes & other veggies, the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down. Other brands may be 'healthier' but are going to be more expensive. We selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine.",Dog Food

"A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.",Dog Food

I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.  Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots.",Dog Food

"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.

"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.",Baby Food/Canned Food

This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt.

This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!)

So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns!

My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.",Cat Food
"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",Cat Food

I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",Popcorn

I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort.
