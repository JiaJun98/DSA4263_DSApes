"I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.",Outliers
"I prefer to stick with organic versions of the ""dirty dozen"" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son ""eat the rainbow"" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!",Outliers
"Being from Europe, I absolutely love these... they taste great, and being sugar-free is an added bonus.  I understand why some Americans may not like these, as Americans in general prefer sweeter foods than Europeans, but if you're unsure I definitely recommend you try them.",Outliers
"I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.",Outliers

"This is a great price for powdered goat milk. At the local health food store (the only place in town that carries goat milk), I buy just one of these cans for $15. $20 for three cans is the best price I've found!  I use goat milk for my children, when they are in the process of weaning, and as long as they want it. It is so much healthier than formula because, well, it's not soy or dairy based, and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk. Goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy, so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk. I find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust, or for those who cannot tolerate dairy.  For warm bottles for my 14-month-old, I just heat water on the stove, then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk. Shake it up and she has her favorite drink (Other than momma's milk, of course)!",Outliers
"We sent this basket to my mother in law for Mother's Day and she loved it.  I was worried because she will definitely let us know if she doesn't like something and she really raved about this.  I didn't see the basket in person, but she said the items in it were all very nice.  She was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included.  She said they looked just like dried flowers, but you use one petal at a time as soap.  She'll be using those in her guest bathroom.  The food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too.  She also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it's own.  This is the 3rd Art of Appreciation gift basket I've sent as gifts and I always get good responses, so I'd feel confident about sending this as a gift.",Outliers

I like the darker chocolate with the nuts better. But, if you're looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts, this is a good choice. I use them as a breakfast food mostly. They don't raise my blood glucose and that's good.",Staple Food/Cooking Products

I puchased an espresso machine for Florida and I am using the Lavazza pods to make espresso and coffee drinks using espresso.  The results are outstanding.  The espresso is bold, smooth and flavorful.  Best of all little to no cleanup.  Just toss the used pod in the garbage and you are done.

"Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast.

"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch,  Black Cherry  and  Orange Tangerine . I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.  Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.  I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.  The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in  Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice , for example.  The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as  essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice  or  San Pellegrino Orange  although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.  In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.  BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try  Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda , which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.",Coffee

The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; it's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee.

"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.",Tea

"I am already a fan/buyer of Lipton's herbal tea, having tried the  Island Mango & Peach ,  the Mandarin Orange  and  Blueberry Pomegranate .  I like the fact that the ingredients are natural - hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry, blueberry, raspberry. It's definitely 'herbal' tea - there are no actual tea leaves in the ingredients (which is why it's caffeine free).  I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)  I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.  Note: I use 9 bags at a time to make a full pitcher of iced tea.",Tea

"I had my doubts about these chips until I got my first case. I always loved and considered, ranch, & sour cream & onion pringle potato chips as the best until I open my first bag of these.

"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.  I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.",Snacks
"These are one of the best tasting potato chips that I have tasted. Nice and crunchy, a little thicker than other chips, and just the right amount of salt.  While these are certainly not a health food, the current packaging boasts that they have 40% less fat than regular chips. The package also boasts ""no artificial flavors, no preservatives, no MSG, no trans fats, made with all-natural ptotatoes and seasonings."" One serving has: 6g fat, of which only 1g is saturated fat; 135mg sodium; 1g sugar, and 2g protein. For potato chips that is pretty good.  Shop for price. The printed price on a 8.5 oz bag is $3.49, and I can get these for less on sale at my local supermarket.",Snacks
"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.  First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.  FYI Nutrition info: Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box Calories 140 Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat Cholesterol 0 Total Carbs 18g Fiber 2g Sugars 0 Protein 2g Sodium 50g  BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people. Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.  Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.  Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!",Snacks
"I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!",Snacks

Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".

"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.  I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.",Dog Food

Anxious eyes, opened socket expanding  wide, the wait was unbearable! After a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle I handed the treats out. Everybody grabbed theirs, there were a few side glances, a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved, nerves you see, and after one or two growls the chewing began.

"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.",Baby Food/Canned Food

It smells and looks bright, and from the first spoonfull (it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!  This is a veggie she doesn't refuse.  She'll eat a jar of this even after a full bottle if I let her!  No side effects noticed and I even tasted it & found it barely sweet and wholesome.  This is a great deal and cheaper than in store; arrives bubblewrapped to death and no weird or broken jars so far.",Baby Food/Canned Food
"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free.

"Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.",Processed Food
"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again.",Processed Food
"I had this for lunch and I enjoyed the flavor and the spice level.  It was a little salty for my taste, but not too bad.  Some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness, but that would also reduce the amount of heat.  The bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch.  Given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value, I would eat this occasionally, not often, to satisfy a craving.",Processed Food
"I switched to Celtic sea salt for added minerals, and also because the body can process it better than table salt. The taste is unbelieveable!! It highlights every flavor of your food! I am so impressed I refuse to go back to table salt for any reason! It is damp, due to being taken directly from a sea bed. Althoug I did not get the grinder the company offers, instead I got one at Target. It works ok, I do have to shake the grinder sometimes to get it to work freely with the damp salt. Overall, I am extermely impressed with this salt.",Processed Food
"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of ""sensitive skin"" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.",Processed Food
"I love the regular version of this soup, and accidentally bought a case of the low-sodium version.  No amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product.",Processed Food
It's so hard to find no sodium seasonings (other than Mrs. Dash) - this is a great product at a great price!,Processed Food
"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!",Cat Food
"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",Cat Food
"I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)  One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.  The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.",Cat Food
I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.,Cat Food
"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it.",Cat Food
"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.",Cat Food
"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",Cat Food
"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.",Cat Food
"i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere UNTIL i bought this brand! best i have ever tasted. no chemical aftertaste.  i have 2 cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too. it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener. mercy! as others have stated, the ups man does all the hard work and i don't have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household.",Concentrated Syrup
I can't say enough about this Philadelphia suburb local company(Bala Cynwyd!).  I hope one day Skinny Water will be linked with Philly like soft prezels and cheese steaks (of course the best cheese steaks are in the suburbs of Philly).  This product got me off soda!!!!,Concentrated Syrup
A certainly refreshing bottle of water and a very large one at that. The taste is very pleasing without the plastic from the bottle taste to taint it. It seems a bit pricey though giving you extra benefits might just be worth the purchase.,Concentrated Syrup
"I haven't crystal light since it was still made with saccharin, but I have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks, but it's  hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache.  Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.  I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.  5 stars.",Concentrated Syrup
"Idk what everyone is freaking out about. It tastes like slightly salty smart water. The color is a little unnerving at first, looks like rust water. A  friend of (nutrition major) likes the idea of it so I can't be that bad...maybe",Concentrated Syrup
"I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and ""crisp"".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something ""good"" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day.",Concentrated Syrup
"The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling).",Concentrated Syrup
"Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.",Concentrated Syrup
"this adds a great taste to your popcorn, its not easy to get the same measurement each time and removing it from the container provided is a bit of a task. The price of this product is high, and even higher depending on your location(shipping costs are very high and are on the rise). this product does not yield as much popped corn as some other products. But it still is the best for Taste, gives a great flavor from the initial popping and not adding any toppings.",Popcorn
We use this popcorn in an air popper on the weekends. It is delicious and tastes much better than anything we have been able to find in the stores.,Popcorn
"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he.",Popcorn
"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again.",Popcorn
Received this set as a gift and they are a wonderful tasting product.  Perfect for my West Bend popcorn maker.,Popcorn
"Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",Popcorn
Great coconut oil! Purchased this to use when making my own popcorn & it is great.  My whole family loves the taste.  After buying this I read that virgin coconut oil is the most healthy for popcorn & was thrilled to get it & see that it is virgin coconut oil.  Love it!  Hope it comes in a larger container for next time!,Popcorn
"I have tried a few brands of truffle salt.  I like it on popcorn.  I thought that this product would be great since it was 10% truffle instead of the 5% I had been purchasing.  Although the aroma of this product is good, the taste is just bad--not awful, bad.  The bitter flavor is at the front, not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor.  I am very disappointed.",Popcorn
"This is the most expensive coconut juice I have ever purchased.  For some reason, I thought it would taste more natural and refreshing than Goya or Foco, which tastes more sweet than natural.  Nope, I was wrong.  It tastes exactly the same as the others, and has the same exact ingredients from Thailand.",Coconut Products

"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.",Coconut Products
"It's light and refreshing.  I've tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut.  The Western coconuts like the ones from the Caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the Far East like Indonesia.  So, comparing this to the Western coconut water, it's way better and much more refreshing.  Comparing this to the Indonesian coconut water, it's below par.  All in all, it's still pretty good.",Coconut Products
"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!  I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.  I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.  To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category.",Coconut Products
I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!,Protein Powder
"I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!  Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other.",Protein Powder
"This protein powder is absolutely delicious! It blends well with no clumps, chunks, or residue. It has a wonderful taste that I recognize from smoothies I've had at ""real"" smoothie bars. My homemade smoothies now taste like I bought them from a shop! I only wish I had bought the 28 oz bags instead of the 14 oz bags. Will definitely correct that for next time!",Protein Powder
"I like this protein powder. On its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than I should have at one time, so I mix one scoop of it with a scoop of EAS 100% whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me. I use this product daily.",Protein Powder
I ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy. I didnt. I have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it. It taste like dirt and grass. Not s very good product.,Protein Powder
"We like to make Smoothies in our home. Throw a little yogurt, some milk, some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm. But sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit. Or sometimes we want a fruit that isn't in season. That is where this smoothie mix comes in.  You put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie. W e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor. Out of the two, we prefer this peach. It has a great flavor and mixes up well.  In addition to using this for smoothies, we also use this when we make ice cream.  This is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack.  Enjoy.",Protein Powder
"I have been taking this for many years and love it.  The taste isn't bad at all, though, if you are used to having your Protein Drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener, you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a McDonald's Milk Shake.  But the taste is fine.  It is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product, as in addition to 26 grams of vegan protein, it is loaded with other healthful nutrients.  Each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it, plus a vitamin complex, and enzymes.  If you are looking for a really excellent Vegan Protein this is the ticket, plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi-vitamin.",Protein Powder
"I don't usually like protein drinks  I DO love coffee and was looking for a good iced coffee mix  This fits the bill perfectly - plus it's good for me :)  I find the vanilla flavor very nice, the texture not very chalky, and the amount in the canister perfect!  I mix with milk - never tried water - it might not be as tasty that way...",Protein Powder

"This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go-to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it's omega-3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it's made in California!  Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store.",Consumable Oil
"LOVE this stuff! Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face. I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too.",Consumable Oil
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",Soup
"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.",Soup
