"Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans. Cooked up great. Very pleased.",Outliers
"This mint is very minty.  It has a stronger mint flavor than the one with sugar.  Only problem, it isn't carried by my local stores.",Outliers
"I didn't order because it doesn't indicate anywhere what size the bottle is, I think that's basic information, maybe you should include that in your description",Outliers
"In my opinion, the DHA soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy. Doesn't hurt that they are healthy, too! I usually drink Silk Brain & Bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work. I tried the ZenSoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised. It's very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk.",Outliers
"Great option for excellent taste, price, and convenience. A repeat customer on these! We order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store.",Outliers
I did not know I was a fan of soy milk! It taste great and I have one in the morning instead of cow's milk. It is also gluten free for all the Celiac's out there. No casein or lactose as well. I have already recommended this to friends.,Outliers
I have given samples to my friends and they agree. I use one tablespoon per 4OZ cup of coffee. I use a 12 oz French press coffee maker and let the coffee brew for 4 minutes. Adjust the mix to your taste and you will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to trying the the other Boyd's coffee blends.,Outliers
"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.",Outliers
"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars).",Outliers
I bought this stuff to take camping to use in recipes and in coffee/teas.  I spent two weeks in the woods and was really glad I bought this item.  It works great and as far as I know there's nothing weird in it unlike most powdered coffee creamers.  It does take a little longer to completely mix in but it's way better.  Note that this is not a milk substitute.  It is a superb cream replacement.,Outliers
