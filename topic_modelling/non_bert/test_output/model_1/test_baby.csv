baby,"It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring.",0
baby,"I purchased this Lavendar for my daughter's BumbleBee themed baby shower to make Lavender Honey Scones. Which I did, and they were a huge success, there were no leftovers! But then I got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes. Our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill. Yum!",1
baby,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work.",1
baby,"This is the next best thing to homemade chicken broth.  I've used this product to make soups, risotto and heighten the taste of gravy.  You may want to use a bit less water than is called for in the instructions",0
baby,Ribs were very tasty and tender and I will definitely buy them again.  Just had to put them in aluminum foil with a little water and heat so easy to fix.,0
baby,"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.  The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.",0
baby,"I am very pleased with this sherry vinegar.  It is a little costly but has a wonderful,robust taste and really makes a tasty vinegrette.",0
baby,"I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.",0
