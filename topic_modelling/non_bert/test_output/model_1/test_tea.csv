tea,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail",0
tea,I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea.,1
tea,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!! Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more. And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM! smiles, grace in VT",1
tea,"My only complaint is that on the bottom of the package, the expiration date is 2001.  I don't think that's correct.  I made several cups of tea before I noticed it, and figured that since I hadn't had any adverse effects, either it was incorrect or it didn't matter.  It tastes refreshing and smells great! The combination of coconut and green tea is awesome!",1
tea,"I do not drink much caffeine, so I need my spearmint leaves to be pure and not cut with other teas. This brand delivers. My first order was for 3 1# packages and I have just completed an order for 4 more. For those of you that want a good refreshing spearmint tea, I encourage you to give this brand a try.",1
tea,"I love this tea! It's so refreshing. I drink it regularly and was able to buy it on ""Subscribe and Save"" through Amazon, so making the price very affordable.",1
tea,This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price.,1
tea,"I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a ""Wood Grain"" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did.",1
