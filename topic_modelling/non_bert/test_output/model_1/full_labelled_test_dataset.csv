I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable).,grocery
"I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.",snacks

"Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.",flavor
This tea is absolutely amazing!  This tea is great tasting and I have noticed it has curbed my cravings and has killed my coffee cravings.  It provides the perfect pick me up without all the side effects of drinking coffee.  Definitely a keeper!,tea
"I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well.

"My labrador LOVES all the treats from Dogswell ! However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China.

So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!",dog
This salt makes anything better.  My burgers take on a wonderful flavor.  I buy more than one at a time so I can share with friends.  The grocery does not stock this item all the time so ordering is the best way to get it.  I always have a bottle on hand.,flavor
"I'm French and moved to USA in 2000. I miss many of the good foods I have in France. The Ricola herbal tea is one of them. I'm glad to discover recently that Amazon sells it. It might be the only place in USA that sells it. It is calming, soothing and taste good. It is good when you are thirsty right before going to bed, when you are sick and when you have a throat ache.",tea
"My wife needs to eat GF.  We discovered this pasta brand and it has been great!  My 9 and 11 year old boys enjoy it as much as my wife does!  You can barley taste the difference between this pasta and the ""regular"" kind.  A must buy if you must eat GF.  Note, b/c of the expense for GF pasta (this brand), typically, I make two pasta ""bowls"", this brand for my wife and the non-GF for the three of us. With the exception of Baked Ziti and lazania.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
"I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.  I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.  Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can.",coffee
This is one of my absolute favorites. Would recommend to anyone. I have even gotten coworkers hooked on it because it is so good.,flavor

"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again. Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores.",chips

"I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of ""sensitive skin"" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.",snacks
"What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?  I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.  For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.  For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.  In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.  So, what's in this stuff?",drinks
"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars).",flavor

"I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative.  ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you ""raw"" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling.  Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested.  If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one. As I scanned the negative reviews I don't think I remember them commenting that the taste wasn't great.  For what's it's worth I tried Vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter, but still doesn't taste as good as this.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing.",carbohydrates_meal

I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k-cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k-cups of each of the 4 flavors. I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that! I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler.",flavor
"I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and ""crisp"".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something ""good"" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day.",baby_meal
"These cookies are not sweet at all, which is ok, but they also have NO flavor at all. They name is vanilla creme cookies- where is vanilla?? The texture is kind of strange too-cookie is crumbly, but around the creme it is crunchy. overall - will not be buying this product ever again.",flavor

There is no bitterness with this milk like there is with some other major brands. Very tasty, and very healthy. Mere 50 calories per serving. Cruelty free too!

"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",dog
"I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don't want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bone's 'long-lasting' promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why don't I describe what happened next... I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since I'd given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that they're expensive? I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. They're cheaper, they last longer, and they don't leave a terrible mess.",dog

"Little lesson on TRUFFLES... Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.  Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.  Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",flavor

"My two basenjis had a few guests over last week end and came the time to share a few bully sticks the atmosphere was electric!  Everybody was sitting nicely, some of them were holding their paw in the air as if to say:"" me first, me first!!!"" The noses were twitching, the tongues were meticulously run over them, turning every piece of olfactive information into tasty dribble. Anxious eyes, opened socket expanding  wide, the wait was unbearable! After a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle I handed the treats out. Everybody grabbed theirs, there were a few side glances, a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved, nerves you see, and after one or two growls the chewing began. It sounded like a mini munching factory. The stench was heavenly and when every little fiber had been devoured we all cheered for ValueBull. Tree times.",dog

"I've never had quinoa but I've read and heard enough about it to finally give in and order some.  This is a lot cheaper than what you would find at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and it's delicious (not to mention great for you).  If you're just getting into Quinoa just search for some recipes on Google - try the quinoa and black bean recipe, it's awesome.  As far as the product goes, it's very neatly packaged and prewashed, so you don't need to rinse it.  The pouches are easy to open and close and that's good because you probably won't use all 16 ounces in one sitting.  The red qunioa looks great in salads, with cereal, or on it's own!",unknown

"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.  I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.  Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.",snacks

"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.

I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.  The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.  My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:  RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99  Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product.

This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.

I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.

I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.

The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.  I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.  This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)  This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.  The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.  West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.  Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.",flavor
"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.  This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality.  It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.  I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.  What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.  I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.  What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.

I have subscribed to this so it will be shipped automatically every month.,coffee
"I've always been a little curious about barley tea, as I see it often mentioned in manga and Japanese stories. I finally got a chance to try it the other day with the Sokenbicha brand.  This tea is not sweetened, which is part of the reason I purchased it. I'm on a diet, so I prefer to sweeten my beverages with stuff like Splenda or Equal. I didn't really need it with this drink. There's a slight bitter tea taste, but it's definitely not overwhelming and I didn't really think that it deterred from the drink. To be honest, I didn't add any sweetener to it at all. It didn't need it and I think it would have killed the taste.  There's a great nutty-ish type of flavor that I'm going to assume is the barley. I adore it and while I don't think I'd be able to drink it constantly, I really want to drink this again, to the point where I'd be willing to drive to the organic grocery store that's about a half hour out of my way. I do have to warn you, if you are a fan of the more traditional teas (black tea, iced tea, etc) then this will take some getting used to. It's tasty, but I can see where it wouldn't be to all tastes. Still very much worth trying and I'm definitely going to be looking for barley tea in general. (But stuff like this is good for me to take to work, where I can't brew up big batches of tea.)",tea

"We like to make Smoothies in our home. Throw a little yogurt, some milk, some ice and lots of fruit into a blender and yummmmm. But sometimes we are out of yogurt or milk or even fruit. Or sometimes we want a fruit that isn't in season. That is where this smoothie mix comes in.  You put this smoothie mix into a blender with some ice and you have a smoothie. W e have tried the peach flavor and the wild berry flavor. Out of the two, we prefer this peach. It has a great flavor and mixes up well.  In addition to using this for smoothies, we also use this when we make ice cream.  This is a great product that will save you time on those mornings when you are rushed and just need something fast for breakfast or a snack.  Enjoy.",flavor

I discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than I remembered them from distant past experiences, and here they are available on Amazon.  The prunes are available as a Kirkland product, and Costco shoppers realize that Kirkland is the Costco store brand, or something like that.  So, I was further actually astonished to discover that my local Costco store sells this same product, 3.5 pound bag, for the amount of $6.40 instead of the $18 to $20 price as they are on Amazon.  Why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in Costco stores for $6.40?  Is this some kind of a gouge?",grocery

"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch,  Black Cherry  and  Orange Tangerine . I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.  Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.  I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.  The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in  Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice , for example.  The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as  essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice  or  San Pellegrino Orange  although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.  In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.  BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try  Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda , which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.",drinks

What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!

I had stopped buying it when the price in my local supermarket kept creeping up so I was really happy to find it on Amazon (Subscribe and Save) cheaper than my local supermarket.

"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!  Martek advertises this formula on their website!  ""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".  Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:  Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients) Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol) Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""  quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.  This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula: AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg  Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""  The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.  Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.  BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.  Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom  The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",dog

"My husband bought this after growing to love this dish after living back east. We currently live in the western US, and I have never had this dish prior to him making it for me. So I cannot offer any comparison. However, I do thoroughly enjoy this dish. When my husband called this Cincinnati CHILI, I got stuck on the chili part, so my taste buds were confused when I first tried this dish, because it doesn't particularly taste like the chili I am used to. After adjusting to the ""sweetness"", I really enjoy this dish more than my husband! It is NOT your typical chili with beans and ""spicy-ness"". It has a smoother consistency and the cinnamon, cloves and allspice give it a different taste entirely.  It is a very easy meal to make. We have it ""4-way"" on top of noodles, with grated cheese and chopped onions on top. I should also mention to others not familiar with this dish is that it is not very substantial on its own. It is also delicious on top of turkey dogs.",dog

"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.  All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.  I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.",drinks

I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.

It's probably even milder than the spicy sauces in an actual Taco Bell restaurant. It actually has a slightly sweet taste.

"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.  On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",drinks

"I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).  In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.  Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.  I'm in love.  This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.  I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.  I never thought I'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from Amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but I'm making an exception for this cocoa.  It's worth it.",flavor

I also like that Lipton uses the least amount of material needed to make the tea bags, and they aren't wrapped individually. (The teas that do so annoy me, as wrapped bags are a time waster and a resources waster - there's no need to wrap each one!)  I especially like the taste of the tea - it has a very nice flavor.

But at $2.50 a pop, that's $75 to get your Vitamin D each month.  Still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend, this is one of the better ones I've run across.

Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect.

I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively.

I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.  Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.  Strike one - utterly stale Strike two - not returnable Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA  [Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]  I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward.

However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.",chips

"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.  The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.  Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.  I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.  Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.  To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.  I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.",snacks

For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)  One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.  The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.",cat

Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since.

"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.  The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.",baby_meal

"This coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there, though I haven't tried the other Melitta roasts (those are next on my list). It is so dark and rich, with a chocolate taste and a great body- reminds me of a good Americano (blows a Starbucks Americano out of the water). I've found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about 7 ounces of water with my BUNN MC pod brewer, on the 'tea' setting. This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process. I'm only taking off one star since I don't know what the issue is. Otherwise, I'm very very pleased with this coffee. I've not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since I purchased it.

The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet.

"I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle. It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!",drinks

"I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid (""It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!"") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick.  Each pouch is designed for 4-6 half inch thick bone-in or boneless chops.  It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water.  No messy clean up.  And the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended 15 minutes.  I used a thermometer to check for the recommended 160 degrees.  The flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty.  For a quick weeknight meal, I will buy this.",flavor

"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.  Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.  I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!  While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.",drinks

"This is almost the kind of fruit soda I'd make if I were going into this business. The difference is that I'd go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).  For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.  My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.

"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.",carbohydrates_meal

"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.  I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.",chips

"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.  The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.  The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.  I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.  The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.  I like these a lot. They make a great snack.",flavor

"That's what I thought when I took the first bite. I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.  First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.  FYI Nutrition info: Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box Calories 140 Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat Cholesterol 0 Total Carbs 18g Fiber 2g Sugars 0 Protein 2g Sodium 50g  BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people. Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.

"I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in ""160ml of water"" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.",baby_meal

They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.  I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.  Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.  I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.",snacks

It is so much healthier than formula because, well, it's not soy or dairy based, and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk. Goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy, so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk. I find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust, or for those who cannot tolerate dairy.

I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",cat
"I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.  When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.  So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.  Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.  I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.  If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.",grocery

"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.  HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!!

"The Switch is marketed as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't""...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors (""natural"" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.  The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.  The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill.",drinks

"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.

"I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) ""Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food."" Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.  update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.  5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track.",cat

You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.

Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.  I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.

"I decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices. I ended up at my local health food store and found Stakich Raw Honey. It is produced about an hour from me, so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies, and liking to support local businesses, I decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. The taste is delicious and sweet. I've used it to replace all of our 'regular' honey uses, and no one in my family can tell the difference. The texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey, but that's to be expected. I mix a tablespoon of Stakich Raw Honey and a teaspoon of Stakich Bee Pollen into my Greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast. Try it, you won't be disappointed!",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face. I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too.",grocery
"A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat. The trainer also suggested we steam the dry food with boiling water so the dogs, especially the Shih Tzu, could smell it. We've been using this brand for some time now, and both dogs love it. Steaming it produces a bit of a gravy. It also softens the food which is helpful for the Shih Tzu. We've tried different types and flavors of dog food in the past, but this one is still a huge hit with the dogs. They also seem quite healthy and active on it.",dog

"This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.  So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!  This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.",coffee

I have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking, and these are an excellent replacementwhen ""fresh"" is not required (such as salads, etc).  They save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking.  The product, while fairly costly (as are fresh shallots), is a real time saver, and worth every penny of the cost.  Freeze dried is much better than just plain dried.  I use freeze dried herbs whenever I can find them, as they more exactly replace fresh products.

Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.

Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not.

I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly.

Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste.

After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.

Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid.

"Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.  You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.  Perfect in every way, and organic!  The only ""con"" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).  The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.  If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.

The straining device that drains excess water after microwaving the pasta works well and the pasta sauce packet contains a sufficient amount of sauce for the pasta.  This mixer takes a little more time and effort that a frozen option due to having the microwave the pasta, drain it and add the sauce.

"It's incredibly tasty.  I'd recommend that any hot/spice lover give it a try.  I'll attempt to give an objective description, but well, it's a spice.  You'll really have to taste it yourself.

Absorption: v.high, v.finely ground; unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test:  Top Ramen Variety Pack 48ct (24-3oz Beef-24-3oz Chicken)   It has a very clean smooth taste, almost like adding pure ""hotness"" to food without the smoky overtone of Tobasco, the roughness of black pepper, or the cumin of chili sauces.  It has a very slight ""cling"" or ""linger""; ie. as with habanero peppers, where the more you eat, the hotter it gets.  One or two sips of water will wash it clean.  I haven't tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes, but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away, it should work very well there.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well.

I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.  In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.",grocery

Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat. My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!",chips
"I recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice. Yes, expensive but I mainly use them when I bake bread. These do taste like garlic and re-hydrate very well. Target carries a line of freeze dried herbs (cost a little cheaper and get little more) and I will compare those to these.",unknown
it was great to find this caribbean cake here. Its truely a real caribbean rum cake. i was in puerto rico only 3 weeks ago for 10 days and I could not find a caribbian cake anywhere. Thanks to Amazon.,carbohydrates_meal

"like all other diet powdered chocolate, it doesn't dissolve well, even in the hottest water.  You have to smash some of it against the side of the cup to get it to dissolve.  I use it in my coffee... mmmmmmmmm yum",coffee
"It tastes great. I've only used it as a supplement and not in cooking. Also, Some people had given concerns over packaging, but mine was completely fine.",dog
"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a & water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.  I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!  Yum. Try it!",snacks
At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.,grocery
"I took this stuff on a two week camping trip.  I put it in chilli, made tacos and soups.  This is the best tasting sour cream powder I've ever come across.  Buy this stuff now!  One bag lasted 6 campers for about 3-4 meals used as a condiment.",chips
"These are actually pretty good. I was not expecting to like them (I don't like chocolate and coconut together) but I did! They are soft and chewy and great for a snack. They are wheat, gluten and dairy free, so they are pretty good for those with allergies or food sensitivities.  Each bar has 180 calories, which is pretty standard. They do have 80 calories, or 9 grams, of fat, 2g of which are saturated. The rest of the contents are pretty good with 8g of sugar and 9g of whole grains. The ingredients are all things you can pronounce and has none of the weird chemicals.  The bar is pretty chewy and tasty. I liked it and may even buy them.",snacks
"This product has great taste, and not too sweet. The tea mixes up in your water like coolaide, and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you. However, the packets do not tear by hand, but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open. That is the only thing that needs to be improved.",tea
"I love this stuff.  There isn't an instant coffee out there that's anywhere near this good.  This isn't even in the same category as any other instant.  It actually tastes like real coffee!  Shocking, but true.  It's (no lie) almost as good as freshly brewed Starbucks.  It's also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick.  However, the stuff is so darned expensive that I feel foolish buying it.  Unfortunately, it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows.",coffee
"I was brewing about 2 pots a day of Starbucks Columbian or other good Columbian coffees until recently at a relative that only had Folgers Instant. I reluctantly tried it and was amazed at the great taste. I couldnt believe how good it was and now I drink it everyday , even more than brewed coffee. I highly recommend trying this.!",coffee
"I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him! Coffee Bean Direct, you need to do better, MUCH better...",coffee
"I wanted to like this product, as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs, but it didn't work well at all.  Very noisy.  Lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices.  Considering the decent reviews by others, I may just have a defective unit.  Either way... it's going back in the mail today.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
"I have purchased two of these products and the only reason my review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because on my second shipment, the cap was loose on one of the bottles and it ended up pouring all over the other bottles in the carton. I was wondering why all my bottles were sticky until I hit the one that was almost completely empty :(  Otherwise great drink.",drinks
"I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.  This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.  I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.  As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may be better off purchasing a larger box (300 or 400 count) instead of this pack of six ... Unless you just really like the size of the 40-count boxes. But if you have never tried it, definitely purchase a smaller box to try it out first!",coffee
I love Chai tea- and these little Keurig K-cups are excellent. My only wish is that they would make a non-dairy one as these have milk in them.,tea
"At a couple bucks a bag indulge yourself!  Heavy with the caramel and the flavor, a bit light on the nuts-but they are in there.  The cranberries are a very nice touch if you like something chewy with your caramel corn.  Comparable to Poppycock but a bit more flavor and lighter on the nuts, a very good change of pace.",flavor
Very fast shipping. I made Hot and Sour soup with these. Re-hydrated these increase in volume almost 4 times. You have to have these to make authentic Hot and Sour soup. They add a nice crunch and have very good health benefits. Will definitely order again.,chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again.",baby_meal
"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more ""natural"" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special.",drinks
I put these in one of those antique looking gum ball machines you can buy for your home.  The yummy hot cinnamon flavor has the perfect amount of heat and sweet.,flavor
I did not care for the taste or texture. I was able to get rid of these by sharing them at  parties.,snacks
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",carbohydrates_meal

These are good but I think I was spoiled by the Blueberry flavor.  They are my favorite.  I like the whole line because they use better quality ingredients. These are delicious but I'd like more figs.,flavor
First time we have used Chebe produce.  We loved it.  Has great taste and easy to make.  Will buy again.,grocery
"I ordered this when I found a few indian recipes that I wanted to try.  It would have been outrageous for me to buy all the spices individually but thankfully I found this.  All the spices come in separate baggies.  My only complaint is that when they arrived they were all jumbled up but there is a list that tells you where each one goes in the box and it was simple to follow,so it was no big deal.",carbohydrates_meal
"I'd seen an add for these in a magazine recently, but my local grocery store hasn't had them in stock, so I was really glad to get the chance to try the Appletini flavor out.  It's delicious!  While it certainly doesn't taste like the real thing, it's got a nice, light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there.  Also, a few reviewers mentioned that it tastes a bit like a Jolly Rancher in its sourness, but I don't think that it's sour at all.  I try not to drink more than one glass of Crystal Light a day because I worry about the aspartame in it, which this one also has.  Overall, a really tasty drink!  I'm eager to try to mojito one next.",flavor
"I was a bit cautious when I first opened the box. I need gluten free and sugar free products with low carbs. This candy fit the bill. The texture is a bit strange but,Wow the candy is tasty and lasts a long time. I bought the ginger, licorice  and raspberry flavor.",healthy food
"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted.",snacks
"Lowrey's has changed it's microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product. I will buy no more Lowrey's microwave pork rinds.",chips
"I have tried 4 different kinds of oolongs, and found this tea to have a very rich, woodsy taste. It brews a dark red/brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs, which brew golden. Although it tastes quite strong, which I like, it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that I love in a previous oolong I've tasted. Those tend to be much more expensive, so I settled for this one. It tastes pretty good & seems good quality for the price. I'm pretty much addicted to oolong tea, so I needed something that I could buy at a good price & still enjoy.",tea
