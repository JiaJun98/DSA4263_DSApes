snack,"These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!",1
snack,"Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!",1
snack,I've tried many of the MTR ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest. I will buy again.,1
snack,Great taste. Candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter. Wrapper sticks to candy. Other than that the candy is perfect.,1
snack,I used these tablets during a demonstration for a talk I gave about taste to a group of student chefs.  Needless to say they were amazed and pleased with the effects.  The tablets were easy to distribute and very effective in turning lemons into candy!  thanks!,0
snack,"These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.",1
snack,"I do not like protein at all. Not protein bars, not protein in my shakes, I just don't like the taste. These bars taste great. I was hesistant to get them because I was afraid they would taste like the protein I hate. BUT, they are great. I like these better than the cereal bars.",1
snack,These were really good. I got them free to try and loved them. Very filling and tasty. Me and my husband shared it and we couldn't wait to buy more.,0
