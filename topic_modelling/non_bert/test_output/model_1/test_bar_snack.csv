bar_snack,"I am a marathon runner and diabetic.  I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!",1
bar_snack,"These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!",1
bar_snack,"I really like Halter bonbons.  They have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy.  Cherry, strawberry, and orange are my favorites.  I do wish they came individually wrapped.  They are often hard to find and somewhat pricey, but in my view they are worth it.",0
bar_snack,"I took a few sips of this stuff, and couldn't help but wonder what all the 5* reviews were for. To me, the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes.  However, by the end of the bottle my opinion was completely changed. It has a very good, sweet chocolate taste. Even better, this stuff is killer for hangovers. I was walking around with a headache and general malaise all day - picked up one of these, drank it, and within an hour or two my headache and general unease was completely gone. I'm sold on this product.",0
bar_snack,"I had these crackers in a snack box on a recent Delta flight and enjoyed them so much I searched the internet to see where I could purchase them locally.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a store in my area that sold them.  The taste is so good you can eat them just as a snack or serve with dips or spreads.  I ordered the Roasted Garlic with Rosemay and also the onion flavored version (which I haven't tried, yet).  Although some reviewers said their Wisecrackers showed up in bits and pieces, mine were in perfect shape.",1
bar_snack,These by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price. Low in calorie and a great after work out snack.,1
bar_snack,"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.",0
bar_snack,These little nut squares are delicious!  There is just enough sweetness to make you feel like you have had a real treat but not so much that you get a sugar high with a crash.  Nuts have protein so these snacks stay with you and give you a needed boost in the middle of the day or anytime.,1
