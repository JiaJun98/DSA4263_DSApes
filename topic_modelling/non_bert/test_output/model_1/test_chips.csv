chips,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.",1
chips,"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.",0
chips,"My kids love this white cheddar snack, but it isn't always easy to find in our shopping area. This wasn't cheap, but we are happy that we can order Pirate Booty through Amazon. The 1 oz. bags are the perfect size for their school lunches. The taste is cheesy and light...love 'em.",1
chips,"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone. If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...",1
chips,"I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions...",0
chips,"I split this bag up into a bunch of sandwich bags and bring them to work with me, they are great little snacks!",0
chips,"I bought these in response to a 'Just For You!' recommendation and was very pleased.  The product was fresh and gummy, not stale at all.  I was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are.  I admire their tasty, tasty glow just before I pop them into my mouth.  I was home when the box arrived and, since it was a warm day, I was glad I was.  The bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm, so I popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while.  When they had cooled, I opened the bag -- it's not a resealable bag -- and divided the bears into 5 ziplocs, eating the ones that fell onto the counter for, ummmm, health and safety reasons.  Hopefully, this will keep them fresh a long while.",0
chips,"ordered this as a healthy snack, and everyone seems to like it around my household, the packaging wasn't the best so one bag ripped open during shipment, other than that it's all good.",0
