ingredient,"I grew up in Portugal eating the real thing, fresh, grilled sardines, and these are very close to that.  They're the best that I have found in this country.  Highly recommend. PLus, it's great that they are in olive oil.",1
ingredient,"Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the ""old"" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!",0
ingredient,"We have this on automatic order with Amazon to take advantage of the improved pricing. We go through about 1 32 ounce box per day and buying from amazon saves us a ton of money (prime members so no shipping cost).  Every once in a while we get a box that was beat up a little bit but not that big of a deal for the amount of money we save buying this stuff in bulk.  I am 100% certain that should I ever feel like complaining to amazon about the shipping issue, they would send me a replacement pronto. That being said, it's really no big deal.",0
ingredient,"...so you know I am serious. I would give it a 0, were it an option. I love Amazon - they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.  The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled/ tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two-foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end.",1
ingredient,"I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!",1
ingredient,"This is a pleasantly vanilla-tinged breakfast cereal.  Organic and gluten free, at about $3 per 10oz box it may not be for everyone, but for those who need to worry about gluten, this cereal is definitely not a trade-off on taste.  I like the texture too, with a satisfying crunchiness that's filling.  I definitely recommend giving this a try.",0
ingredient,I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.,1
ingredient,"Local markets don't carry wild rice or charge about $6 for 6 ounces. After searching the net, this was the best deal I could find and it is a good, high quality rice that cooks up great. Enjoy!",1
