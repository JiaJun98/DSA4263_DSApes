chocolate_milk_nuts,"The Just Tomatoes brand combines nutrition and fresh taste.  The whole family loves these freeze-dried strawberries, but of most important note, my 2 year old loves these (even though she won't eat fresh strawberries).  They are less messy too!  We like to take them on the road when we're traveling so we get some fruit in when it's not convenient to eat fresh.  The other reviews are accurate in their description of texture loss - especially in humid climates.  However, the strawberries are still tasty when they are a little chewy.  In fact, I prefer them that way.  This is one of the few fruits my husband will take in his lunch!",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.,1
chocolate_milk_nuts,"This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.   We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.   I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).  Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended.",1
chocolate_milk_nuts,"We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he.",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,"Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off.",1
chocolate_milk_nuts,"We tried all different saimins (noodles), the dashi (soup)is most delicious. Didn't know Koreans made saimins too. They are better then Japanese saimins (noodles). Cannot wait till I receive them.",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,Not much to say. I grew up on this stuff and it is very good.,0
