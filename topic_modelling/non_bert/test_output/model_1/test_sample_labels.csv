unknown,I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.,0
unknown,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!",0
unknown,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.  I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout.",0
unknown,"These colors are so true to life and vibrant!  The drip, drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again.  The food color doesn't change the taste or texture of any food.  I had no problems with shipping, and it was super fast.",0
unknown,This Organic Baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency..my son has to drink it. It is also very sweet. Nice as a desert but not for a meal for my 10 month old.,0
unknown,This adds something special to a regular burger and fries.  My husband loves spicy foods and he loves the kick that this gives him.,0
unknown,"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it.",0
unknown,"I recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice. Yes, expensive but I mainly use them when I bake bread. These do taste like garlic and re-hydrate very well. Target carries a line of freeze dried herbs (cost a little cheaper and get little more) and I will compare those to these.",0
coffee,"This is my new addiction! The best white chocolate sauce there is. I have a standing monthly order. Now I can enjoy my favorite white chocolate iced coffee everyday, instead of once or twice a week.",0
coffee,"This is an easy to make cake and it tastes really good. It is almost the same as the Coffee Cake I usually buy at Seattles Best Coffee House which is more than $2.00 a slice. It is really worth it for the price you paid. My family really loved it, we even eat it at breakfast.  I highly recommend this product, you can serve this on parties too, by using muffins pans. I usually use small bundt pans so my kids have their own individual cakes, they really love it!!!",1
coffee,"I've been drinking this coffee every morning for about a year now and really like it. The 5-pound bag lasts a while, so it's an excellent value. It smells wonderful when you first open it. I'm so glad to not be spending a fortune on grocery store coffees anymore.",1
coffee,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste.",1
coffee,"I am a coffee fanatic - drink it day and night, no, coffee does not keep me awake.  I am enjoying the flavor of Emerils bold.  When I got my Keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of Emerils coffee.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could order larger amounts than at the Keurig site.  I am so glad I did as, yes, Amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price.  This will become one of my repeat orders in the future.",1
coffee,"I've tried many of the various coffee sticks out there, but these are the best tasting. Not that strong, but not like water either. Perfect for me. To me it tastes like the coffee you get at the TGIF restaurants, so that's why I like it. Easy and tasty! Just how I like my women.",1
coffee,THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.,1
coffee,"I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.  I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.  Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can.",1
tea,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail",0
tea,I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea.,1
tea,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!! Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more. And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM! smiles, grace in VT",1
tea,"My only complaint is that on the bottom of the package, the expiration date is 2001.  I don't think that's correct.  I made several cups of tea before I noticed it, and figured that since I hadn't had any adverse effects, either it was incorrect or it didn't matter.  It tastes refreshing and smells great! The combination of coconut and green tea is awesome!",1
tea,"I do not drink much caffeine, so I need my spearmint leaves to be pure and not cut with other teas. This brand delivers. My first order was for 3 1# packages and I have just completed an order for 4 more. For those of you that want a good refreshing spearmint tea, I encourage you to give this brand a try.",1
tea,"I love this tea! It's so refreshing. I drink it regularly and was able to buy it on ""Subscribe and Save"" through Amazon, so making the price very affordable.",1
tea,This is pretty good tea.  I use it to make iced tea.  I will usually use two of these tea bags with a few of the cheap plain tea bags in order to make mango tea that doesn't taste like mango juice.  Good stuff at a great price.,1
tea,"I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a ""Wood Grain"" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did.",1
flavoring,"Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans. Cooked up great. Very pleased.",1
flavoring,I bought this product from vitacost.  I really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor.  I decided to purchse from Amazon because it's in bulk thereore cheaper.  It'sso worht it. I've tried a lot.  This mix really impressed me.  No chocolate to melt in the car.,1
flavoring,"I haven't crystal light since it was still made with saccharin, but I have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks, but it's  hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache.  Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.  I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.  5 stars.",1
flavoring,I discovered these at my local Trader Joe's but then they stopped carrying them.  I hunted and located them under their original 'colors'.  They make a very tasty vegetable broth - carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths.,1
flavoring,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.  The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.  The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.  I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.  The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.  I like these a lot. They make a great snack.",1
flavoring,"So happy I got this on a subscription. I might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. I've used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. It's not mild like olive oil, but it has enhanced the flavor of everything I've cooked!",1
flavoring,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant when I read through the ingredients. Sure, it sounded healthy, but would it taste good?  In a word, outstanding! Good crunch, flavor and just the right amount of salt. Great to see that there's snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos.  The only problem is that everyone likes them, so they disappear quickly!",1
flavoring,"Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.",1
baby,"It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring.",0
baby,"I purchased this Lavendar for my daughter's BumbleBee themed baby shower to make Lavender Honey Scones. Which I did, and they were a huge success, there were no leftovers! But then I got creative and exploded with lavendar recipes. Our favorite so far has been a roasted pork loin on the grill. Yum!",1
baby,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work.",1
baby,"This is the next best thing to homemade chicken broth.  I've used this product to make soups, risotto and heighten the taste of gravy.  You may want to use a bit less water than is called for in the instructions",0
baby,Ribs were very tasty and tender and I will definitely buy them again.  Just had to put them in aluminum foil with a little water and heat so easy to fix.,0
baby,"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.  The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.",0
baby,"I am very pleased with this sherry vinegar.  It is a little costly but has a wonderful,robust taste and really makes a tasty vinegrette.",0
baby,"I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.",0
healthy food,"Wow!  I actually picture the peanut butter cookie fresh out of the oven as this hits my tastebuds!  I was just looking for a gluten free meal replacement bar.  Lucky me, I found a delicious meal alternative that keeps me full for hours!",1
healthy food,"I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.  Mix is cheaper here than at Albertsons and Whole Foods.  Hodgson Mill batch tests using an ELISA Gluten Assay test.  all natural, gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free.",1
healthy food,I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.,1
healthy food,"Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack.",1
healthy food,"I really like Halter bonbons.  They have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy.  Cherry, strawberry, and orange are my favorites.  I do wish they came individually wrapped.  They are often hard to find and somewhat pricey, but in my view they are worth it.",1
healthy food,"This is a pleasantly vanilla-tinged breakfast cereal.  Organic and gluten free, at about $3 per 10oz box it may not be for everyone, but for those who need to worry about gluten, this cereal is definitely not a trade-off on taste.  I like the texture too, with a satisfying crunchiness that's filling.  I definitely recommend giving this a try.",1
healthy food,"This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The ""mouth feel"" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.",1
healthy food,"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!",1
chips,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.",1
chips,"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.",0
chips,"My kids love this white cheddar snack, but it isn't always easy to find in our shopping area. This wasn't cheap, but we are happy that we can order Pirate Booty through Amazon. The 1 oz. bags are the perfect size for their school lunches. The taste is cheesy and light...love 'em.",0
chips,"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone. If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...",1
chips,"I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions...",0
chips,"I split this bag up into a bunch of sandwich bags and bring them to work with me, they are great little snacks!",0
chips,"I bought these in response to a 'Just For You!' recommendation and was very pleased.  The product was fresh and gummy, not stale at all.  I was surprised at how brightly colored these bears are.  I admire their tasty, tasty glow just before I pop them into my mouth.  I was home when the box arrived and, since it was a warm day, I was glad I was.  The bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm, so I popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while.  When they had cooled, I opened the bag -- it's not a resealable bag -- and divided the bears into 5 ziplocs, eating the ones that fell onto the counter for, ummmm, health and safety reasons.  Hopefully, this will keep them fresh a long while.",0
chips,"ordered this as a healthy snack, and everyone seems to like it around my household, the packaging wasn't the best so one bag ripped open during shipment, other than that it's all good.",0
dog,"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue",0
dog,I received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box.  She stepped back and walked away without hesitating.  I smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it.  I checked the other 9 in the box and they all smelled the same...bad.  What a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them.  I won't be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats.,1
dog,"I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive.",1
dog,"Mycodex Plus Environmental Control Aerosol Household Spray is amazing. The basement was full of fleas this year. One can sprayed onto the basement floor took care of the problem. Other products have been tried, as well as flea bombs having been set off. Nothing else seemed to work. This stuff is A Plus. Would definitely use again if ever there was a need.",0
dog,"I know it's just double more here than what I found locally, but wait it's double! I don't know about this source anymore, I shop here very cautiously now since I find a lot of products overpriced  big time!",0
dog,"I had purchased the premium variety of these treats when Costco carried them, and my dogs loved them.  I bought the original recipe  treats here because the premium was too expensive.  What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad.  Since I cannot find a use-by date on the package, I do not trust that this is a wholesome, safe product.  the remainder has gone into the rubbish.  For the safety of your animals, I advise that you not purchase these from Amazon.  I believe they sell old product.",1
dog,"I was very pleased with the shipping of this item. When I thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty, it had actually come 2 days prior.  My dog couldn't be happier",1
dog,My doberman LOVES the primal dry roasted dog treats and they are rated one of the healthy snacks for dogs on Whole-Dog-Journal!,1
grocery,"I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com",1
grocery,it arrived in a timely manor and in great shape... by ordering on line i saved close to $100 and couldn't be more happy,0
grocery,"This is a really great product, not sweet at all. The name describes it perfectly. However I am not sure why it is $40 a case. I would buy it in the store. Much cheaper",1
grocery,"I bought these for my husband. It's almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores, & he's thrilled with these! Fast shipping, highly recommend.",1
grocery,"It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I get from the store (no damage or anything); Not much else to say.",1
grocery,"I couldn't find any cake flour at the grocery stores close by, so I decided to get it online. However, I just found out that you can get the exactly same product at Whole Foods for less than half the price. It's actually only $4.99 for a 32oz pack.",1
grocery,"Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",0
grocery,"These raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which I assume indicates that they are fresh, unlike the store bought (H-E-B) raw kernels that were pretty bland. They are also extremely nutritious: high in iron, protein and fiber. Actually, pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about 25% more protein than beef per 100 gram. The price produces somewhat of a sticker shock, though, at over seven bucks per pound; however, considering all of the fiber and nutrients, I believe they are well worth the price. Bob's Red Mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site. I highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and, as you can from the facts below, are at the top of the nutrition chart.

snack,"These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!",1
snack,"Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!",1
snack,I've tried many of the MTR ready to eat meals and this is one of the tastiest. I will buy again.,1
snack,Great taste. Candy gets a gooey texture after sitting on counter. Wrapper sticks to candy. Other than that the candy is perfect.,0
snack,I used these tablets during a demonstration for a talk I gave about taste to a group of student chefs.  Needless to say they were amazed and pleased with the effects.  The tablets were easy to distribute and very effective in turning lemons into candy!  thanks!,0
snack,"These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that.",1
snack,"I do not like protein at all. Not protein bars, not protein in my shakes, I just don't like the taste. These bars taste great. I was hesistant to get them because I was afraid they would taste like the protein I hate. BUT, they are great. I like these better than the cereal bars.",1
snack,These were really good. I got them free to try and loved them. Very filling and tasty. Me and my husband shared it and we couldn't wait to buy more.,0
sweet drinks,Love these. They taste so good and are good for you. I love giving my son something that is not full of un-natural sugars!,1
sweet drinks,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.  Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.  I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!  While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.",0
sweet drinks,"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.",1
sweet drinks,I find these to be addictively tasty.  I like the 6 oz tins because if I eat a whole tin it's not really that bad (compared to 12 oz).,1
sweet drinks,This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!,0
sweet drinks,"So many  flavorings like this sound and look great but taste funky, this tastes great . I have only tried the black cherry , and it does give you a little boost as well, not a caffiene heart thumper.",0
sweet drinks,"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.  On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",1
sweet drinks,"These gummi vitamins taste great - -sweet and sour. Made with arctic cloudberries, which are like yellow raspberries but not as sweet. Suitable for adults as well as kids.",1
carbohydrates,I get it from my grocery store for $1.50 a box and 3 boxes will be $4.50. I love the flavor. This is ridiculously over-priced.,0
carbohydrates,"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore.",0

Great packaging, great taste, great addition to the cluttered assortment of snacks.  Solbites gets five stars from Fiat of Montgomeryville.  Look for our next order!",0
carbohydrates,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.",1
carbohydrates,This candy can be purchased anywhere fom $2.00 a box to .65 cents a box. I ordered 3 cases of it at .97 cents a box and I thought I got a fair deal.,0
carbohydrates,"I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.",0
carbohydrates,"There isn't a whole lot that is special about Stride Gum. I kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time. It doesn't really freshen your breath and you don't get the ""clean"" feeling of other gums. It doesn't really last that long either so I wasn't too fond of it. Either way if your a fan of Stride go for it.",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,"The Just Tomatoes brand combines nutrition and fresh taste.  The whole family loves these freeze-dried strawberries, but of most important note, my 2 year old loves these (even though she won't eat fresh strawberries).  They are less messy too!  We like to take them on the road when we're traveling so we get some fruit in when it's not convenient to eat fresh.  The other reviews are accurate in their description of texture loss - especially in humid climates.  However, the strawberries are still tasty when they are a little chewy.  In fact, I prefer them that way.  This is one of the few fruits my husband will take in his lunch!",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.,0
chocolate_milk_nuts,"This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.   We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.   I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).  Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended.",0
chocolate_milk_nuts,"We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!",1
chocolate_milk_nuts,"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he.",0

cat,"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!",1
cat,"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",1
cat,"My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed ""stuff"". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!",1
cat,"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.",1
cat,"My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day. He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out. I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his ""treat."" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these.",1
cat,Grew up with them as a kid in California. Then disappeared for years. Found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon. I'm very happy to have a breakfast favorite back!,0
cat,"cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!",1
