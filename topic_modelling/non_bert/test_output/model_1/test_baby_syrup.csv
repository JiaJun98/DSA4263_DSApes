baby_syrup,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.  HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.  I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.",1
baby_syrup,"The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling).",1
baby_syrup,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.",0
baby_syrup,These have a great taste and are very crispy. Just cheese so they are good if you are trying to go low carb or are gluten free. The only problem I had was they are expensive.,0
baby_syrup,consistency is ok but product is absolutely tasteless - might be possible to add to other cereals but not much fun to eat by itself,0
baby_syrup,I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.,0
baby_syrup,"This quick bread is really easy to make even though it does require extras to be added.....2 eggs and 1/2 cup of melted butter and water.  It cooks up fast and easy and tastes great.  It's a bit on the heavy side...sort of like pound cake with very few poppy seeds but it's truly enjoyable.  I would recommend it for an occassional treat but a lot of butter is used so I wouldn't suggest daily intake of it.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it too.",0
baby_syrup,"It's incredibly tasty.  I'd recommend that any hot/spice lover give it a try.  I'll attempt to give an objective description, but well, it's a spice.  You'll really have to taste it yourself.  Hotness: mild or roughly like  TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 12 oz.   Saltyness: none!  It's just pepper.  Absorption: v.high, v.finely ground; unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test:  Top Ramen Variety Pack 48ct (24-3oz Beef-24-3oz Chicken)   It has a very clean smooth taste, almost like adding pure ""hotness"" to food without the smoky overtone of Tobasco, the roughness of black pepper, or the cumin of chili sauces.  It has a very slight ""cling"" or ""linger""; ie. as with habanero peppers, where the more you eat, the hotter it gets.  One or two sips of water will wash it clean.  I haven't tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes, but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away, it should work very well there.",0
