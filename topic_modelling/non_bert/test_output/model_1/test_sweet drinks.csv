sweet drinks,"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again.",0
sweet drinks,I love this coconut oil. It adds a great coconut flavor to baked goods. I love the coconut smell when I use it as lotion or hair conditioner. Tastes good and so healthy for you too! Good bargain when you get free shipping through Amazon.,1
sweet drinks,"I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).  In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.  Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.  I'm in love.  This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.  I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.  I never thought I'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from Amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but I'm making an exception for this cocoa.  It's worth it.",1
sweet drinks,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant when I read through the ingredients. Sure, it sounded healthy, but would it taste good?  In a word, outstanding! Good crunch, flavor and just the right amount of salt. Great to see that there's snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos.  The only problem is that everyone likes them, so they disappear quickly!",0
sweet drinks,"Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.",0
sweet drinks,Very tasty and filling if you are watching your diet.  It has a lot of flavor and satisfies that craving for chocolate....,0
sweet drinks,I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.,0
sweet drinks,"I have tried a few brands of truffle salt.  I like it on popcorn.  I thought that this product would be great since it was 10% truffle instead of the 5% I had been purchasing.  Although the aroma of this product is good, the taste is just bad--not awful, bad.  The bitter flavor is at the front, not an aftertaste and there is not a strong truffle flavor.  I am very disappointed.",0
