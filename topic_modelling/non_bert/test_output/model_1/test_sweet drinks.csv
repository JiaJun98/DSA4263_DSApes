sweet drinks,Love these. They taste so good and are good for you. I love giving my son something that is not full of un-natural sugars!,0
sweet drinks,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.  Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.  I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!  While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.",1
sweet drinks,"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.  And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.  Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.",1
sweet drinks,I find these to be addictively tasty.  I like the 6 oz tins because if I eat a whole tin it's not really that bad (compared to 12 oz).,0
sweet drinks,This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!,0
sweet drinks,"So many  flavorings like this sound and look great but taste funky, this tastes great . I have only tried the black cherry , and it does give you a little boost as well, not a caffiene heart thumper.",0
sweet drinks,"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.  On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",1
sweet drinks,"These gummi vitamins taste great - -sweet and sour. Made with arctic cloudberries, which are like yellow raspberries but not as sweet. Suitable for adults as well as kids.",0
