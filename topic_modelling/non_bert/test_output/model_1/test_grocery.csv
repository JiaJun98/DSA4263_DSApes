grocery,"This honey tastes great, plus the fact that it is raw, and research indicates it may be useful in the healing of stomach ulcers is a bonus.",1
grocery,"I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle. It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!",1
grocery,"It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I get from the store (no damage or anything); Not much else to say.",1
grocery,You can buy this bread directly from Udi's for a lot cheaper. The Bread is great but not at this price.,1
grocery,"I purchased this on a whim after eating a butternut squash pasta dish at a very nice restaurant. I am  VERY leery of canned/jarred pasta sauce and almost always prefer to just make my own from scratch. However, this sauce is just divine! It has a very robust taste and is pleasantly sweet. I paired it with cheese ravioli and it was just perfect. I think that it would be great with just about any pasta. It is a pleasant change from a tomato based sauce and is very satisfying. I highly recommend!",1
grocery,This is great convenience to have on my counter next to my Keurig and Kcups! I really think this is a great value too!,1
grocery,I needed to fill a giant pepper mill. I didn't know if this package would be enough. I had leftovers.,0
grocery,"This new ""Packaging"" is more expensive than the last plus it's smaller - 23.2 oz vs. the 25 in the old packaging.  Granted it's nice not having to fish around for the scooper, but there's no reason to increase pricing on this.  Target had the 25 oz for $19.99 at one point (maybe try to clear old packaging for new) - now it's at $21.05 still cheaper than what I've seen online - even for amazon- so far...",1
