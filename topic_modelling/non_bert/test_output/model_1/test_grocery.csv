grocery,"This is a really great product, not sweet at all. The name describes it perfectly. However I am not sure why it is $40 a case. I would buy it in the store. Much cheaper",1
grocery,"I bought these for my husband. It's almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores, & he's thrilled with these! Fast shipping, highly recommend.",1
grocery,"It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I get from the store (no damage or anything); Not much else to say.",1
grocery,"I couldn't find any cake flour at the grocery stores close by, so I decided to get it online. However, I just found out that you can get the exactly same product at Whole Foods for less than half the price. It's actually only $4.99 for a 32oz pack.",1
grocery,"Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.  It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.",1
grocery,"These raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which I assume indicates that they are fresh, unlike the store bought (H-E-B) raw kernels that were pretty bland. They are also extremely nutritious: high in iron, protein and fiber. Actually, pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about 25% more protein than beef per 100 gram. The price produces somewhat of a sticker shock, though, at over seven bucks per pound; however, considering all of the fiber and nutrients, I believe they are well worth the price. Bob's Red Mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site. I highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and, as you can from the facts below, are at the top of the nutrition chart.
