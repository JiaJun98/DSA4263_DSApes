healthy food,"Wow!  I actually picture the peanut butter cookie fresh out of the oven as this hits my tastebuds!  I was just looking for a gluten free meal replacement bar.  Lucky me, I found a delicious meal alternative that keeps me full for hours!",1
healthy food,"I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.  Mix is cheaper here than at Albertsons and Whole Foods.  Hodgson Mill batch tests using an ELISA Gluten Assay test.  all natural, gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free.",1
healthy food,I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.,1
healthy food,"Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack.",1
healthy food,"I really like Halter bonbons.  They have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy.  Cherry, strawberry, and orange are my favorites.  I do wish they came individually wrapped.  They are often hard to find and somewhat pricey, but in my view they are worth it.",0
healthy food,"This is a pleasantly vanilla-tinged breakfast cereal.  Organic and gluten free, at about $3 per 10oz box it may not be for everyone, but for those who need to worry about gluten, this cereal is definitely not a trade-off on taste.  I like the texture too, with a satisfying crunchiness that's filling.  I definitely recommend giving this a try.",1
healthy food,"This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The ""mouth feel"" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.",1
healthy food,"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!",1
