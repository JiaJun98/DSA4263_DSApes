flavoring,"Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans. Cooked up great. Very pleased.",1
flavoring,I bought this product from vitacost.  I really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor.  I decided to purchse from Amazon because it's in bulk thereore cheaper.  It'sso worht it. I've tried a lot.  This mix really impressed me.  No chocolate to melt in the car.,1
flavoring,"I haven't crystal light since it was still made with saccharin, but I have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks, but it's  hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache.  Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.  I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.  5 stars.",1
flavoring,I discovered these at my local Trader Joe's but then they stopped carrying them.  I hunted and located them under their original 'colors'.  They make a very tasty vegetable broth - carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths.,1
flavoring,"Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.  The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.  The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.  I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.  The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.  I like these a lot. They make a great snack.",1
flavoring,"So happy I got this on a subscription. I might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. I've used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. It's not mild like olive oil, but it has enhanced the flavor of everything I've cooked!",1
flavoring,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant when I read through the ingredients. Sure, it sounded healthy, but would it taste good?  In a word, outstanding! Good crunch, flavor and just the right amount of salt. Great to see that there's snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos.  The only problem is that everyone likes them, so they disappear quickly!",1
flavoring,"Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.",1
