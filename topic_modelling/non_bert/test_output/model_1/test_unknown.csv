unknown,I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.,0
unknown,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!",0
unknown,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.  I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout.",0
unknown,"These colors are so true to life and vibrant!  The drip, drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again.  The food color doesn't change the taste or texture of any food.  I had no problems with shipping, and it was super fast.",0
unknown,This Organic Baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency..my son has to drink it. It is also very sweet. Nice as a desert but not for a meal for my 10 month old.,0
unknown,This adds something special to a regular burger and fries.  My husband loves spicy foods and he loves the kick that this gives him.,0
unknown,"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it.",0
unknown,"I recently discovered freeze dried foods and these garlic bits are very nice. Yes, expensive but I mainly use them when I bake bread. These do taste like garlic and re-hydrate very well. Target carries a line of freeze dried herbs (cost a little cheaper and get little more) and I will compare those to these.",0
