cat,"My 14 year old cat wasn't eating, had to have a tooth pulled, and was generally miserable.  He's always been thin and a picky eater.  After the tooth was pulled, he was interested in food, but wouldn't eat.  I had to squirt it in his mouth a few times before he got the idea I wasn't going to give up.  Once he started drinking it, he loved it and began asking for it.  His coat is thicker and doesn't fall out as much.  He's put on weight, and even if he's having a 'sick day' from hair balls, he can drink this without throwing up the rest of the day.  He's so much happier and plays more.  Now even if there's a day when he isn't interested in food, I don't worry as much because he's so much healthier now.  Thank You !!",1
cat,"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.  When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",1
cat,"My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed ""stuff"". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!",1
cat,"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.",1
cat,"My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day. He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out. I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his ""treat."" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these.",1
cat,Grew up with them as a kid in California. Then disappeared for years. Found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon. I'm very happy to have a breakfast favorite back!,0
cat,"cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!",1
cat,"[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago.  I was very disappointed with the quality.  I was unable to eat these sardines.  They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture.  Sorry product.  I'm giving them to the cats.  B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]",1
