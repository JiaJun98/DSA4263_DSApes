cat_ingredient,"I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) ""Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food."" Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the ""scientists"" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.  update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.  5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track.",1
cat_ingredient,"I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :( I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty.",0
cat_ingredient,"My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed ""stuff"". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!",1
cat_ingredient,"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it.",0
cat_ingredient,These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.,0
cat_ingredient,"When I decided to become veggie, my boyfriend frowned.  He figured that we'd be giving up on all these foods that he likes.  I made these sloppy joes for him though, and he couldn't even tell the difference!  We're talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled.  I figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again, anybody would like them.",0
cat_ingredient,"Wow, i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars. The other posters say they notified Earth's Best about this in August and they are still selling it without checking or recalling!! No more earth's best for my little guy. I am taking my business elsewhere and I am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars. They gotta do better than this to get my business.",0
cat_ingredient,This Organic Baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency..my son has to drink it. It is also very sweet. Nice as a desert but not for a meal for my 10 month old.,0
