chip_snack,Since I have to watch my sodium I have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile.  Campbell's made one but no longer does.  If you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better.,0
chip_snack,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.",1

chip_snack,"This protein powder is absolutely delicious! It blends well with no clumps, chunks, or residue. It has a wonderful taste that I recognize from smoothies I've had at ""real"" smoothie bars. My homemade smoothies now taste like I bought them from a shop! I only wish I had bought the 28 oz bags instead of the 14 oz bags. Will definitely correct that for next time!",1
chip_snack,"These Takis have a great taste to them! Tried them about 3 weeks ago, and now I love them. The taste is great, they are very spicy and hot, but they are also very good. The crunchy, lime, hot taste they have is just one of the best.",1
chip_snack,"My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day. He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out. I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his ""treat."" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these.",0
chip_snack,I order this for my office and everyone loves it. I think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such.,1
chip_snack,"I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions...",0
