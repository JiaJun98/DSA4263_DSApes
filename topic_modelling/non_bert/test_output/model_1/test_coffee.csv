coffee,This is a smooth coffee with a good taste.  I don't like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect.  It has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all.,1
coffee,"I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the ""base"", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.  As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.  I will try a different brand next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!",1
coffee,"This product has bad reviews because it is quite horrible. Unlike most of the Keurig K-cups, this one tastes very artifical. It is extremely bitter and not sweet. It seems like it has excess cocoa and artificial sweetner, yet all watered down.",0
coffee,"This coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing.  My husband drinks a lot more coffee than I do, and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee.  We are looking forward to trying Melitta's other varieties.",1
coffee,"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old?? Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy.",1
coffee,Over priced for what you can get from the manufacturer directly and also have a much larger selection of different coffees - as well as the new chocolate flavor - do not understand why anyone would buy USED coffee - by its nature coffee cannot be USED,1
coffee,"This is the best tasting health drink I have had. I wanted something with Resveratrol but did not want to have to take a pill. This tastes like grape Gatorade almost. Really good. Price wise, it is pricey. But I am only drinking one a day and it is no more expensive than some people's Starbucks coffee in the morning.",1
coffee,"I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.  I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.  Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can.",1
