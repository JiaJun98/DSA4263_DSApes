coffee,"This is my new addiction! The best white chocolate sauce there is. I have a standing monthly order. Now I can enjoy my favorite white chocolate iced coffee everyday, instead of once or twice a week.",1
coffee,"This is an easy to make cake and it tastes really good. It is almost the same as the Coffee Cake I usually buy at Seattles Best Coffee House which is more than $2.00 a slice. It is really worth it for the price you paid. My family really loved it, we even eat it at breakfast.  I highly recommend this product, you can serve this on parties too, by using muffins pans. I usually use small bundt pans so my kids have their own individual cakes, they really love it!!!",1
coffee,"I've been drinking this coffee every morning for about a year now and really like it. The 5-pound bag lasts a while, so it's an excellent value. It smells wonderful when you first open it. I'm so glad to not be spending a fortune on grocery store coffees anymore.",1
coffee,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste.",1
coffee,"I am a coffee fanatic - drink it day and night, no, coffee does not keep me awake.  I am enjoying the flavor of Emerils bold.  When I got my Keurig it came with a sample pak and in it were two samples of Emerils coffee.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could order larger amounts than at the Keurig site.  I am so glad I did as, yes, Amazon had larger paks at a very reasonable price.  This will become one of my repeat orders in the future.",1
coffee,"I've tried many of the various coffee sticks out there, but these are the best tasting. Not that strong, but not like water either. Perfect for me. To me it tastes like the coffee you get at the TGIF restaurants, so that's why I like it. Easy and tasty! Just how I like my women.",1
coffee,THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.,1
coffee,"I love coffee, and this product was a nice mid-afternoon pick me up. It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.  I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.  Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can.",1
