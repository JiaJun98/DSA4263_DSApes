dog,"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue",0
dog,I received this product and eagerly offered the dog the first biscuit out of the box.  She stepped back and walked away without hesitating.  I smelled the biscuit and it had a rancid peanut butter smell to it.  I checked the other 9 in the box and they all smelled the same...bad.  What a shame since we had purchased these previously and the dog enjoyed them.  I won't be purchasing anymore online and will stay with the local pet store for fresh treats.,1
dog,"I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive.",1
dog,"Mycodex Plus Environmental Control Aerosol Household Spray is amazing. The basement was full of fleas this year. One can sprayed onto the basement floor took care of the problem. Other products have been tried, as well as flea bombs having been set off. Nothing else seemed to work. This stuff is A Plus. Would definitely use again if ever there was a need.",0
dog,"I know it's just double more here than what I found locally, but wait it's double! I don't know about this source anymore, I shop here very cautiously now since I find a lot of products overpriced  big time!",0
dog,"I had purchased the premium variety of these treats when Costco carried them, and my dogs loved them.  I bought the original recipe  treats here because the premium was too expensive.  What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad.  Since I cannot find a use-by date on the package, I do not trust that this is a wholesome, safe product.  the remainder has gone into the rubbish.  For the safety of your animals, I advise that you not purchase these from Amazon.  I believe they sell old product.",1
dog,"I was very pleased with the shipping of this item. When I thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty, it had actually come 2 days prior.  My dog couldn't be happier",1
