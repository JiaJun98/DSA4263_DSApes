dog,"Mycodex Plus Environmental Control Aerosol Household Spray is amazing. The basement was full of fleas this year. One can sprayed onto the basement floor took care of the problem. Other products have been tried, as well as flea bombs having been set off. Nothing else seemed to work. This stuff is A Plus. Would definitely use again if ever there was a need.",0
dog,"rye oats wheat rice and barley are not part of a dogs evolutionaly history so why feed unnatural foods. Dogs are carnivors. Green Cow is a good value and will extend your pets healthy life. i started feeding green cow to my 13 year old Golden 18 months ago. this is my 7th golden and number 8 will get tripe from the start. also it should be noted that she gets 45 minutes of hard exercise daily. dont let age slow your pet down. if you have an older large dog with hind leg and back arthritis you may want to try Pyhcox, I double the recommended dose. my observation is these 2 products have decreased my pets pain and stiffness increased her muscle mass and improved her daily life.",1
dog,"My dog hates this food, and through some research I have found that Science Diet is not very good quality. I have instead switched over to Orijen, a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog.",1
dog,"I have to say this is the best deal for milk bones on amazon, and of course, my dog go crazy just looking at the unboxed milk-bone.",1
dog,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",1
dog,"I was very pleased when this arrived at the door - opened it immediately & dug in - wasn't till later when my wife got home & told me it was for the dog, not me.  Just kidding - our dog does like this Beneful, we get many compliments on her smooth coat, she's fit, full of fun & energy & very healthy. Dry dog food has added advantage if you have to curb your pet. Dogs do like variety too, Beneful has several different flavors, you may want to change it up every other bag or so. This 15.5 lb bag lasts about a month for our 50 lb Lab.  Sounds funny for a dog to be eating corn, tomatoes & other veggies, the reality is these ingredients are fillers to keep the cost down. Other brands may be 'healthier' but are going to be more expensive. We selected this brand because that is what the rescue center fed her and our vet said this was fine.",1
