ingredients,"Cliff Bars stopped making my FAVORITE foodbar - Organic Nectar Cocoa & Walnut.  Dates was one of the main ingredients.  I have multiple food allergies and this was one of the only foodbars I liked and was ok for me.  I wrote to Cliff expressing my sadness about discontinued item and was even more disappointed to not receive any response.  So, thanks to the internet and bloggers, I was able to come up with a receipe to make my own Cliff Bar knock offs :)  Thank you!!  I have bought these dates several times and have always been pleased.  Hope Amazon.com continues to carry!",0
ingredients,"Excellent choice for a high fiber cracker.  These taste great and like other Back to Nature items, don't have all the undesirable ingredients you'd like to avoid if necessary. Whole wheat, safflower oil, salt and Vitamin E -- perfect.",1

ingredients,These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!,1
ingredients,This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.,1
ingredients,"I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.",1
ingredients,"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue",0
