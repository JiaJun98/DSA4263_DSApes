grocery_sauce_spread,"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.",0
grocery_sauce_spread,I could eat this right out of the jar.  I am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter I use in my smoothies.  It is alot less messy and tastes delicious.  Even my husband is surprised. Luv it!,1
grocery_sauce_spread,"I discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it.  Went looking for it cheaper and found it here.  Was shocked by the 2 poor reviews.  Come on - you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi, with a very minimal ingredient/additive list.  Did you think it would taste as ""good"" as the versions loaded with white flour, sugar and oils?  The product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce I put over it.",1
grocery_sauce_spread,Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!,0
grocery_sauce_spread,"This ""squeezy fruit"" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don't understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don't pay this price, that's crazy!",1
grocery_sauce_spread,My husband loves velveeta shells and cheese so we HAD to try these!! Very quick and easy. Don't need anything but the meat. But you may want to add a salad or some veggies for a round dinner! :),1
grocery_sauce_spread,"Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.  Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.  They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.",1
grocery_sauce_spread,Shame on you! These are great mixers and the 5-packs are on sale at Target for just under 8 bucks each!,0
