drinks,The tiny bubbles and flavor choice makes this an above average non-alcholic beverage.  Others tend to be more like soda pop.,1
drinks,"Although this is no substitute for the real thing, the flavor is good enough when you need a substitute.",0
drinks,"I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!",1
drinks,"I often buy products like this to use when traveling, because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road.  This tasted like fresh-brewed tea and disolved completely.  I wasn't stuck with a residue on the bottom.  Just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor.",1
drinks,"Really yummy!  I ate them all within 2 days!  =/  They taste better than fruit by the foot, which I also like.  I'd definitely like to buy some more in the future.",1
drinks,Product was received from vendor quickly.  It is the best tasting non calorie juice around.  So glad to be able to get it here.  thanks,1
drinks,"I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that I'd need to drink 2-3 cans at a time -- 8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.  If it came in a 20oz can, I'd be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.  Really tasty product, though, and I've got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum.",1
drinks,"Has a smooth taste like it claims without any unpleasant metallic flavor. Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.",1
