chips_salty snacks,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite.",1
chips_salty snacks,"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.  The soup is good.  Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong.  If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high.  To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.  Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future.",1
chips_salty snacks,"I had my doubts about these chips until I got my first case. I always loved and considered, ranch, & sour cream & onion pringle potato chips as the best until I open my first bag of these. Let me tell you, no chip is better than these are; I got excellent taste buds to prove it. Therefore, if these chips are extremely good to me , then I know they will be tasty to other people. Try a bag and you will see, trust me.",1
chips_salty snacks,"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.  I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.",1

chips_salty snacks,I ordered these because I needed a flat sucker to put a round sticker on for a shower favor. I had no idea what they tasted like but they turned to be really good actually! I recieved exactly 4 broken suckers in the whole pack of 48. I didn't think that was bad at all for such a fragile product!,0
chips_salty snacks,"Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware - might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up.",1
