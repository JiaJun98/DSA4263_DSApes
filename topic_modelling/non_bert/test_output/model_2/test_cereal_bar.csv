cereal_bar,"I like this product because it has a lot of protein, and WHEY protein since I am allergic to soy which is in almost everything else. It tastes good, promises no junk included, and seems to work well for me.",1
cereal_bar,"Several people have written in to say that their Larabars were old and crumbly.  I just received a box of 16 Chocolate Coconut Chew Larabars and they are in date, moist, have a good consistency, and are delicious.  This is a perfect mid-morning or after workout snack.  I love that they are raw, vegan, Kosher, contain all-natural ingredients and have no processed sugar.  These taste better, are healthier, and have a better texture than most lines of exercise-oriented energy bars.",1
cereal_bar,"I discovered Think Thin products at my local Trader Joe's market. But, the per bar price was a bit high. Then I saw that Amazon sold them and had so many more flavors. I have been ordering them one by one. This is one of my favorites. I like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate. It may be a little too sweet. I like the darker chocolate with the nuts better. But, if you're looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts, this is a good choice. I use them as a breakfast food mostly. They don't raise my blood glucose and that's good.",1
cereal_bar,"My kids love these, and like a lot of reviewers have said, they don't have corn syrup or chemical artificial sweeteners in them. It's still candy, but treat wise.. it's a treat I don't mind my kids having in moderation.",0
cereal_bar,"The Cinnamon Roll flavors are not quite as good as the other Larabars.  There is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes.  However, they are still very tasty!",1
cereal_bar,This is a great tasting product. It doesn't have any sugar. It flows just like honey!,0
cereal_bar,"Just a hint of honey and lemon, perfect balance, great taste, doesnt even need to be sweetened.",0
cereal_bar,"I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there.",0
