coffee_hot beverage,"When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate.",1
coffee_hot beverage,"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore.",1
coffee_hot beverage,"I eat quite a bit of sushi, and I have to say this sushi nori is up to par. Overall, the flavor is fine and the quality is amazing for the price. Can't do much better than this if you're trying to be conservative with what you spend on sushi.",0
coffee_hot beverage,"I rarely can find this on the Keurig website, it's usually sold out, plus it's more expensive. If you love chocolate, you should love this. I recommend it!",1
coffee_hot beverage,"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!).",0
coffee_hot beverage,This was a great price as opposed to the Wal-Mart price for the same brand. My kids love to eat these as an after school snack and this price allows me to provide them with this.  Olivia,0
coffee_hot beverage,This product is fantastic.  I have had Creme Brulee many times in France and this is just the same! I would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it.,0
coffee_hot beverage,We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again,0
