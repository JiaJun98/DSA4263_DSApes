coffee,This is a smooth coffee with a good taste.  I don't like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect.  It has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all.,1
coffee,"I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.",1
coffee,These pumpkin seeds were exactly the same as the ones they sell at markets for nearly $4 for half the price.,0
coffee,Tasted bland - did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions - Would not buy again,0
coffee,"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old?? Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy.",1
coffee,"I have always been a fan of Annie's products, and since I'm overseas at the moment, I didn' have access to the products. That's where Amazon comes in! The price is very good-almost the same as buying them in the store in the states-and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either! As for the product itself, I think the sauce can use less salt, but other wise I love it! Natural ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes for me to make it =)",0
coffee,THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.,1
coffee,"I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon.",0
