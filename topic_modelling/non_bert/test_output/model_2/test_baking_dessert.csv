baking_dessert,"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.  I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.  For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try  Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) .",1
baking_dessert,"I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free. However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a brand new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!  This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON. I will not be purchasing this item again.",0
baking_dessert,Very pleased with the quality of this product. A beginner at cake decorating this was very easy to work with and the flavor was great as expressed by all that tasted it. Will be ordering more product from this company.,1
baking_dessert,"This was the best ever fruitcake. Loaded with fruit and nuts, lite on the cake, as it should be. Not like others, all cake and not much in the way fruit and nuts. The only problem I had is that it's all gone, and fast. Must now order more.",1
baking_dessert,"This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The ""mouth feel"" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an ""emergency treat"" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.",1
baking_dessert,"Neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products, but we love cornbread.  This mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us.  Nice to find an alternative that tastes so great!  Appreciate having this order size option as well since it's often missing from grocery store shelves.",1
baking_dessert,"Tried this and the Chicken, neither left a pleasant taste at all. They were bitter and just not good for a soup base.",1
baking_dessert,BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER,0
