527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.","['icicle', 'mic', 'xlr', 'jack', 'computer', 'usb', 'jack', 'phantom', 'power', 'mics', 'signal', 'software', 'usefulness', 'mic', 'acceptable', 'level', 'akg', 'blue', 'encore', 'akg', 'sound', 'conventional', 'recording', 'chain', 'audible', 'record', 'level', 'encore', 'staple', 'location', 'voice', 'encore', 'digital', 'audio', 'recorder', 'xlr', 'cable', 'mic', 'preamp', 'phantom', 'power', 'eq', 'clean', 'clear', 'sound', 'level', 'peak', 'input', 'level', 'disappointing', 'mic', 'preamp', 'icicle', 'preamp', 'usb', 'input', 'computer', 'decent', 'record', 'level', 'extra', 'equipment', 'light', 'weight', 'gadget', 'better', 'decent', 'channel', 'strip', 'mic', 'preamp', 'xlr', 'jack', 'channel', 'strip', 'computer', 'input', 'icicle', 'blue', 'product', 'better', 'one', 'channel', 'combine', 'piece', 'equipment', 'box', 'mic', 'preamp', 'compressor', 'higher', 'end', 'unit', 'eq', 'capability', 'option']",2

I made it yesterday, and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar, after it was cooked, then put it under the grill to melt the cheese.

1293,"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous.

4040,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again.
