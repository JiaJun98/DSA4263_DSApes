92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.","['lot', 'cereal', 'lot', 'high-fiber', 'kind', 'oatmeal', 'mini', 'shredded', 'wheat', 'raisin', 'bran', 'instance', 'healthier', 'option', 'tried', 'kashi', 'cereal', 'plain', 'cardboard', 'grape', 'nut', 'horrendous', 'yeast', 'cat', 'food', 'closer', 'litter', 'texture', 'antioxidant', 'berry', 'yogurt', 'crunch', 'better', 'high-fiber', 'cereal', 'decent', 'health', 'bar', 'broken', 'cereal', 'cluster', 'yogurt', 'plain', 'cereal', 'decent', 'yes', 'sugar', 'fiber', 'calorie', 'part', 'bran', 'wheat', 'higher', 'sugar', 'calorie', 'lower', 'dietary', 'antioxidant', 'bonus', 'line', 'grocery', 'list', 'sale', 'price', 'right']",4
93,"Lately I've been trying about 20 or more sauces to find just the right one that balances flavor and burn.  But, to put this into perspective, I really go for the insanely hot so this may need to be measured by that.  This sauce is not really that hot, but the taste is awesome.  It definately has heat, but doesn't really have much burn.  In short; if you want something that shames commercial pizza place hot wings in both heat and taste this is a great choice.

122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.

131,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW  Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?  Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!  The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.  ~ Ana Mardoll","['pasta', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'parma', 'rosa', 'creamy', 'tomato', 'incredible', 'pasta', 'mix', 'love', 'sauce', 'pasta', 'higher-fat', 'alfredo', 'sauce', 'cheese', 'sauce', 'acidic', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'acid', 'reflux', 'spaghetti', 'meatball', 'life', 'eh', 'sauce', 'aisle', 'knorr', 'alfredo', 'packet', 'parma', 'rosa', 'sauce', 'idea', 'sauce', 'reviewer', 'creamy', 'tomato', 'alfredo', 'creamy', 'light', 'tomato', 'exquisite', 'acid', 'content', 'low', 'stomach', 'wonderful', 'impulse', 'eating', 'parma', 'rosa', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'easy', 'instruction', 'milk', 'powdered', 'mix', 'packet', 'reason', 'packet', 'smaller', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'versus', 'jar', 'mean', 'price', 'local', 'market', 'parma', 'rosa', 'pound', 'seasoned', 'ground', 'beef', 'easy', 'portion', 'meal', 'sauce', 'packet', 'sauce', 'store', 'fridge', 'person', 'leftover', 'mardoll']",4
152,"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}  I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.  This is a great product.

927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.","['sort', 'thing', 'rare', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'brand', 'doubt', 'main', 'competitor', 'better', 'mixed', 'almost-cheese', 'sauce', 'milk', 'toss-up', 'term', 'nutrition', 'nutritional', 'champ', 'prepared', 'calorie', 'calorie', 'mg', 'sodium', 'kraft', 'velveeta', 'cheesy', 'skillet', 'overall', 'protein', 'g', 'g', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'g', 'gram', 'competitor', 'difference', 'attributable', 'cheese', 'sauce', 'edge', 'total', 'fat', 'g', 'ground', 'beef', 'difference', 'daily', 'fat', 'significant', 'brand', 'transfat', 'list', 'oil', 'ingredient', 'half-gram', 'disclosure', 'package', 'cup', 'dinner', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'g', 'transfat', 'saturated', 'fat', 'ground', 'beef', 'gram', 'sodium', 'meal', 'daily', 'value', 'sodium', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'definition', 'sound', 'choice', 'case', 'thing', 'price', 'availability', 'equal']",4

988,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.  The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.  However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.","['favorite', 'healthy', 'cereal', 'mix', 'texture', 'flavor', 'sweet', 'indulgent', 'nut', 'cereal', 'huge', 'fan', 'banana', 'distinguishable', 'sweet', 'fruity', 'flavor', 'cereal', 'slight', 'nuttiness', 'flax', 'green', 'tea', 'subtle', 'undetectable', 'flavor', 'cereal', 'downside', 'cereal', 'healthy', 'cereal', 'market', 'calorie', 'cup', 'gram', 'fiber', 'gram', 'protein', 'kashi', 'golean', 'cereal', '14.1-ounce', 'box', 'pack', 'calorie', 'gram', 'fiber', 'g', 'protein', 'cup', 'result', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'filling', 'hungrier', 'faster', 'golean', 'breakfast', 'flavor', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'sweeter', 'complex', 'nutritionals', 'bit', 'tastier', 'healthier', 'mainstream', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'difference', 'optimum', 'rebound', 'kashi', 'golean', 'flavor', 'best', 'word', 'cereal', 'overall', 'cereal', 'kashi', 'golean', 'bland']",4

1064,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

1096,"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it.

Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.

1357,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon).

1394,"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.  Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.  Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.

2080,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars.

They are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack.

I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.

The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.

2478,"Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.  The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.

The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.

While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.

2798,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):  Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)  )","['review', 'people', 'alot', 'product', 'review', 'time', 'total', 'complete', 'popchips', 'star', '1-2', 'packaging', 'extra', 'point', 'better', 'version', 'baked', 'lay', 'man', 'wrong', 'baked', 'lay', 'flavor', 'go-to', 'original', 'baked', 'lay', 'sour', 'cream', 'lay', 'favorite', 'regular', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'flavor', 'popchips', 'burnt', 'airpocket', 'chip', 'baked', 'lay', 'benefit', 'use', 'portion', 'control', 'zip', 'lock', 'bunch', 'baked', 'lay', 'way', 'summary', 'popchips', 'burnt', 'air', 'chip', 'sort', 'weird', 'alot', 'suggest', 'bag', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'week', 'm', 'local', 'krogers', 'nutrition', 'information', 'bag', 'calorie', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'mg', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'g', 'sugar', 'protein', 'g', 'vitamin', 'c', 'calcium', 'iron', 'big', 'bag', 'bbq', 'popchips', 'big', 'bag', 'bbq', 'lay', 'nutrition', 'information', 'side-by-side', 'pop', 'chip', 'size', 'chip', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'baked', 'lay', 'chip', 'calorie', 'total', 'fat', 'sodium', 'potassium', 'total', 'carbohydrate', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'vitamin', 'c', 'calcium', 'lay', 'win', 'potassium', 'sodium', 'leaving', 'potassium', 'fiber', 'vitamin', 'better', 'careful', 'sodium', 'intake', 'fact', 'lay', 'potassium', 'huge', 'benefit', 'end', 'decision', 'bag', 'store', 'favorite', 'flavor', 'baked', 'lay', 'popchips', 'lay', 'hand', 'start', 'well-priced', 'variety', 'single-serve', 'bag', 'baked', 'lay', 'seller', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'bag', 'smart', 'mix', 'variety', 'pack', '30-count', '7-baked', 'lay', 'classic', '6-baked', 'cheetos', '6-baked', 'ruffle', '6-baked', 'doritos', 'cheese', '5-rold', 'gold', 'tiny', 'twist', 'pack']",4
