5,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.  I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.   When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.","['store', 'seller', 'problem', 'expiration', 'date', 'coffee', 'picky', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'kind', 'stronger', 'brew', 'flavored', 'coffee', 'suppose', 'chemical', 'coffee', 'consumer', 'folgers', 'different', 'flavor', 'theirs', 'k-cup', 'brand', 'disappointed', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'sip', 'sort', 'chemical', 'strong', 'flavor', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'time', 'unable', 'cup', 'coffee', 'entire', 'cup', 'equivalent']",5

15,I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund.

30,Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.

52,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.","['update', 'january', 'regular', 'drinker', 'stuff', 'fact', 'price', 'afforable', 'free', 'shipping', 'delicious', 'steal', 'coffee', 'folgers', 'home', 'year', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'aroma', 'regular', 'creamer', 'sugar', 'treat', 'bud', 'cup', 'smooth', 'coffee', 'tea-spoon', 'full', 'make', 'cup', 'coffee', 'maker', 'right', 'hard', 'line', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'stronger', 'package', 'little', 'hard', 'best', 'way', 'scissors', 'metal', 'package', 'possible', 'coffee', 'way', 'sure']",5
76,I was looking for all natural flavored coffee (not easy to find) when my college aged son brought some of this home.

133,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.  When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).  For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.","['big', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'better', 'judgement', 'stomach', 'condition', 'decaf', 'year', 'cheapest', 'coffee', 'near', 'office', 'lot', 'money', 'penny', 'melitta', 'cafe', 'ground', 'coffee', 'cup', 'pleasant', 'aroma', 'little', 'cream', 'splendas', 'little', 'light', 'bitter', 'decaf', 'pureness', '50-cent', 'coffee', 'cup', 'couple', 'day', 'coffee', 'coffee', 'wine', 'different', 'variety', 'level', 'bitterness', 'gourmet', 'coffee', 'one', 'local', 'coffee', 'mcdonald', 'free', 'cup', 'pack', 'price', 'decent', 'decaf', 'worth', 'try']",5
140,"The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.  Delivery was unexpectedly fast.  The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack.

So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters.  I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had.

2797,"Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as  Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count  and  Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count ), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.  I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.

2847,"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.

FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories.

3260,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends. Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory. A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines. A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste.

I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.

It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.

Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.
