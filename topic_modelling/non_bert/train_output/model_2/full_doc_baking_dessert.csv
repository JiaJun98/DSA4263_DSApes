29,I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.

Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.,"['box', 'gift', 'box', 'piece', 'seder', 'gift', 'return', 'window', 'matzo', 'seder', 'april', 'night']",4

This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.  1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an ""instant buckwheat""  2. It tastes quite different than ""usual""  3. There is a strong metallic smell  4. This item is overpriced.

It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.
