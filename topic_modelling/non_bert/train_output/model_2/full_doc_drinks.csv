1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.","['citrus', 'drink', 'bubble', 'addition', 'punch', 'fruit', 'juice', 'draw', 'bit', 'family', 'beverage', 'choice', 'treat', 'indulgence']",3

24,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.","['vine', 'se', 'water', 'mixture', 'apple', 'grape', 'tangerine', 'concentrate', 'list', 'apple', 'grape', 'fruit', 'sweetener', 'beverage', 'taste', 'calorie', 'lot', 'oz', 'water', 'carbohydrate', 'gram', 'carbs', 'gram', 'apple', 'grape', 'concentration', 'fructose', 'fruit', 'sugar', 'beverage', 'cane', 'sugar', 'child', 'drink', 'hit', 'parade', 'pretend', 'mass', 'concern', 'girth', 'growth', 'coke', 'sparkling', 'water', 'calorie', 'familglia', 'pomegranate', 'lime', 'lemon', 'orange', 'flavor', 'time', 'time', 'supermarket', 'pure', 'fruit', 'juice', 'pomegranate', 'cup', 'glass', 'water', 'quarter', 'cup', 'bottle', 'water', 'juice', 'extract']",3
28,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.

77,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

79,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.","['coconut', 'water', 'hint', 'pineapple', 'indonesia', 'container', 'sport', 'market', 'source', 'electrolyte', 'ounce', 'container', 'serving', 'teenager', 'adult', 'impression', 'teen', 'athlete', 'drink', 'mention', 'sport', 'result', 'vote', 'drink', 'pineapple', 'flavor', 'feeling', 'mouth', 'teen', 'coconut', 'water', 'flavor', 'straw', 'package', 'opening', 'pouring', 'assistance', 'fork', 'sugar', 'water', 'bother', 'issue', 'waste', 'coconut', 'sugar', 'water', 'indonesia', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'container', 'symbol', 'milk', 'carton', 'community', 'line', 'sugar', 'water', 'transport', 'packaging', 'waste', 'culture', 'sustainability']",3

Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky.

So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.

1067,"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.  The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.  This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it.","['drink', 'mix', 'factor', 'stuff', 'second', 'lot', 'calorie', 'drink', 'condition', 'future', 'drink', 'sweet', 'packet', 'drinking', 'glass', 'fruit', 'flavor', 'sweetness', 'bit', 'pineapple', 'flavor', 'honey', 'home-brewed', 'tea', 'mix', 'box', 'powder', 'mixing', 'problem', 'glass', 'couple', 'second', 'layer', 'glass', 'drink', 'packet', 'calorie', 'alternative', 'drink', 'calorie', 'sweetener', 'mix', 'beverage', 'water', 'time', 'experience', 'drink', 'mix', 'standard']",3

1591,"First, my shipment arrived without any dent or leak in any of the cans which is awesome. I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :  - Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.  - Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.  - Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.  - Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.  - Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.  Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.  The can size is a little small but it is easy to pack with your lunch to take on the go.","['shipment', 'dent', 'leak', 'can', 'flavor', 'cherry', 'cherry', 'grape', 'grape', 'soda', 'fruit', 'juice', 'grape', 'juice', 'carbonation', 'orange', 'flavor', 'friend', 'drink', 'juice', 'flavor', 'lemon', 'combination', 'flavor', 'tartness', 'flavor', 'flavor', 'candy', 'cherry', 'flavor', 'boyfriend', 'line', 'variety', 'pack', 'flavor', 'bf', 'drink', 'soda', 'corn', 'size', 'lunch']",3

Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.  So I'm stuck with 11 packs.  See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.

3007,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.","['celtic', 'game', 'friend', 'apartment', 'game', 'hey', 'brian', 'yeah', 'lavender', 'soda', 'fridge', 'lavender', 'soda', 'person', 'soda', 'couch', 'furniture', 'section', 'marshall', 'kitchen', 'lavender', 'soda', 'experience', 'scent', 'lavender', 'soap', 'soda', 'experience', 'sip', 'time', 'flavor', 'club', 'soda', 'glass', 'soap', 'cleaning', 'flavor', 'drinking', 'experience', 'case', 'soda', 'aftertaste', 'soap', 'residue', 'soap', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'memory', 'childhood', 'boy', 'mother', 'mouth', 'soap', 'word', 'disrespectful', 'father', 'mother', 'conviction', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'effect', 'year', 'flavor', 'soap', 'mouth', 'word', 'lavender', 'soda', 'flood', 'emotion', 'word', 'rule', 'vision', 'cloudy', 'control', 'motor', 'function', 'bluthering', 'mess', 'floor', 'memory', 'soda', 'episode', 'summary', 'soda', 'soap', 'palate']",3

Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.

After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.

So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice.  When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate.  The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.  Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.
