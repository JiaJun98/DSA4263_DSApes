35,"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!","['cup', 'k-cups', 'cup', 'instruction', 'filter', 'coffee', 'lid', 'trouble', 'filter', 'size', 'shape', 'edge', 'cup', 'cup', 'filter', 'lid', 'coffee', 'k-cup', 'cup', 'keurig', 'machine', 'vinegar', 'result', 'effort']",7

210,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)  Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""  Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.  Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.  So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:    * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)   * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces   * a combination of the above two factors   * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract   o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease   o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation   o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage  Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.  Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.  Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.  When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.    The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.  The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top  Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.  The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.  The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top  Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:    * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.   * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).    Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:    Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""    ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""    For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.    * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.   * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.   * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)   * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)  Top  Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:    * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.    The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.    * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.

Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.

1714,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.  I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS.

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.","['star', 'article', 'pregbaby', 'florida', 'review', 'thing', 'similac', 'brand', 'baby', 'ny', 'time', 'article', 'sugar', 'article', 'parent', 'organic', 'baby', 'reason', 'similac', 'formula', 'brand', 'formula', 'cane', 'sugar', 'sucrose', 'sugar', 'health', 'problem', 'baby', 'similac', 'pediatrician', 'risk', 'baby', 'cane', 'sugar', 'sucrose', 'sugar', 'baby', 'sweeter', 'formula', 'food', 'study', 'gain', 'predictor', 'childhood', 'obesity']",7

There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.

The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal.

I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.

2429,"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's.

I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me.

I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag. I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition.

We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).

3980,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.  Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.  I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.  I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.","['sure', 'hit', 'chalk-a-holics', 'sip', 'heritage', 'chalk', 'mine', 'france', 'case', 'calorie', 'keurig', 'chai', 'latte', 'chocolate', 'miss', 'tub', 'foil', 'packet', 'miss', 'stuff', 'size', 'keurig', 'capsule', 'cocoa', 'milk', 'cup']",7

4010,My child was exclusively breastfed for 4 1/2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my breastmilk started to dry up).  She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.

Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.  So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine.
