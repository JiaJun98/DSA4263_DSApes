45,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,"['lowrey', 'pork', 'rind', 'bag', 'bag', 'bag', 'rind', 'money', 'store', 'bag', 'bag', 'half', 'bag', 'penny', 'consumer', 'money', 'reason']",9

Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.

128,"We recently fell in love with Indian food.  Papads (after quickly toasted in a HOT oven) can be a healthy alternative to potatoe chips.  They are excellent alone or dipped in chip dip.

We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.  Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.

220,These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months.  Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips.

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.  As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.  I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

307,"You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.  I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.  I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all.

One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.","['salt', 'concentration', 'seawater', 'world', 'sea', 'salt', 'varies', 'sea', 'salt', 'flavor', 'salt', 'hint', 'mineral', 'price', 'salt', 'price', 'place', 'opinion', 'thing', 'sea', 'salt', 'grinder', 'shaker', 'salt', 'cellar', 'glass', 'jar', 'stove', 'cooking', 'salt', 'table']",9

I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible.

Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.  The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...  Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.  The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.  And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.  The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.  But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"".

2798,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):  Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)  )","['review', 'people', 'alot', 'product', 'review', 'time', 'popchips', 'star', 'packaging', 'point', 'version', 'lay', 'man', 'flavor', 'go-to', 'lay', 'cream', 'lay', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'bbq', 'lay', 'flavor', 'popchips', 'airpocket', 'chip', 'lay', 'benefit', 'portion', 'control', 'zip', 'lock', 'bunch', 'lay', 'way', 'popchips', 'air', 'chip', 'sort', 'alot', 'bag', 'grocery', 'store', 'week', 'm', 'krogers', 'nutrition', 'information', 'bag', 'calorie', 'sodium', 'mg', 'carbohydrate', 'fiber', 'g', 'sugar', 'protein', 'g', 'vitamin', 'c', 'calcium', 'iron', 'bag', 'popchips', 'bag', 'bbq', 'lay', 'information', 'pop', 'chip', 'size', 'chip', 'sodium', 'carbohydrate', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'lay', 'chip', 'calorie', 'sodium', 'potassium', 'carbohydrate', 'fiber', 'sugar', 'calcium', 'lay', 'win', 'potassium', 'sodium', 'leaving', 'potassium', 'fiber', 'vitamin', 'sodium', 'intake', 'fact', 'lay', 'potassium', 'benefit', 'end', 'decision', 'bag', 'store', 'flavor', 'lay', 'popchips', 'lay', 'hand', 'start', 'variety', 'single-serve', 'bag', 'lay', 'seller', 'price', 'bag', 'mix', 'variety', 'pack', 'lay', 'cheetos', 'ruffle', 'doritos', 'gold', 'twist', 'pack']",9

2881,"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.

I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.  I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.  We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.  I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.  *Update* 8/25/11  Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.

3453,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...","['chip', 'chip', 'england', 'fan', 'bag', 'sale', 'supermarket', 'sale', 'advantage', 'bag', 'chip', 'chip', 'yellow', 'color', 'flavor', 'way', 'crisp', 'chip', 'kettle', 'bag', 'chip', 'chip', 'browner', 'chip', 'ingredient', 'process', 'batch', 'chip', 'year', 'reply', 'thanks', 'experience', 'chip', 'bag', 'inspection', 'potato', 'vary', 'variation', 'chip', 'thanks', 'code', 'bag', 'comment', 'staff', 'coupon', 'purchase', 'flavor', 'butter', 'experience', 'purchase', 'case', 'date', 'instance', 'bag', 'case', 'inspection', 'time', 'thanks', 'coupon', 'week', 'help', 'bag', 'time', 'bag', 'chip', 'bag', 'cost', 'research', 'kettle', 'equity', 'company', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'management', 'process', 'kettle', 'company', 'brand', 'recognition', 'merchant', 'margin', 'company', 'customer', 'base', 'brand', 'brand', 'profit', 'company', 'paper', 'profit', 'investor', 'customer', 'employee', 'course', 'buyer', 'brand', 'chip']",9

My secret pate recipe:  5 ounces rendered duck fat 1 lb chicken livers 1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons) 1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press 1 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 1 tbs cognac or dry sherry One loaf of 2""x2"" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter) Olive oil Garlic salt Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator. Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.","['duck', 'fat', 'company', 'chicken', 'liver', 'pate', 'palletes', 'pate', 'duck', 'fat', 'pound', 'liver', 'tollerance', 'pate', 'recipe', 'ounce', 'lb', 'chicken', 'liver', 'shallot', 'tablespoon', 'provence', 'marjoram', 'thyme', 'work', 'press', 'tsp', 'sea', 'salt', 'pepper', 'tb', 'cognac', 'sherry', 'loaf', 'rye', 'pumpernickel', 'look', 'counter', 'oil', 'garlic', 'salt', 'pate', 'ingredient', 'liver', 'mixture', 'food', 'processor', 'add', 'mixture', 'food', 'processer', 'seasoning', 'cool', 'refrigerator', 'bread', 'heat', 'slice', 'oil', 'place', 'layer', 'sheet', 'pan', 'salt', 'cook', 'minute', 'crouton-like', 'doneness']",9

4043,These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.

I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient.

The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!

4243,"I don't like cinnamon and I don't like apples, so I was surprised when a friend offered me  Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  and I liked it. I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.  I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh.","['cinnamon', 'apple', 'friend', 'cinnamon', 'apple', 'chip', 'ounce', 'bag', 'pack', 'cinnamon', 'pound', 'chip', 'reviewer', 'roommate', 'pound', 'chip', 'reason', 'star', 'packaging', 'nutrition', 'information', 'chip', 'size', 'cup', 'calorie', 'food', 'scale', 'case', 'use', 'gram', 'chip', 'calorie', 'g', 'fiber', 'dad', 'variety', 'fruit', 'tree', 'apple', 'apple', 'care', 'reason', 'bag', 'bag', 'ziplocs', 'snack', 'sort', 'chip', 'bag', 'ziplock', 'crispy']",9
