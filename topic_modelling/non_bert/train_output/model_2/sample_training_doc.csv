Very tasty product..good for you and tastes good..great combo.  I love it over the top of vanilla yogurt..yummmy,breakfast_tea
"When I opened the package, I thought this tea smells exactly like Italian pignoli macaroons.  But, the taste is definitely ""darker"" and more bitter; perhaps I let it steep too long, or perhaps sweetener would bring out the ""cookie"" flavor more.  Whatever.  Black, it tastes pretty similar to the Republic of Tea Vanilla Almond flavor, which I also like.  This tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas, BTW, so it's probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings.",breakfast_tea
I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!,breakfast_tea
"I just finished brewing a container of this tea to keep in the fridge.  I pre-sweetened it with some simple syrup, making it less sweet than most restaurants serve it as I don't care for super sweet tea.  I'm not a connoisseur but this tastes very similar to the teas I have had in restaurants.  I do wish there was no artificial food coloring (yellow).",breakfast_tea
"I add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium.  It clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender, but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non-organic milk.  It is hard to find around here, and I'm glad Amazon carries it.  They offer it cheaper than special ordering it from the health food store.  I add it to homemade icing and ice cream too!",breakfast_tea
this plant appears to be dead on arrival.... ive had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well 20.00 for a dead weed... no thanks they wouldnt let me submit this review with out clicking a star... not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine...i have three,breakfast_tea
"I tried couple of green tea but I like this green tea very much, great taste sweet smell will order more soon :)",breakfast_tea
The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.,breakfast_tea
"This sunflower tastes really great, very original flavor not over salted. And the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large. Overall, it is the best sunflower seed that I ever eat in America.",coffee
This is the most expensive water I've seen. Who are they marketing to...lottery winners only? Nobody should pay this much.,coffee
"My husband and I love this coffee it has a nice smooth taste.  Sets our morning off to a good start even though it is D-caf  Delivery was fine, no problems at all.",coffee
This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.,coffee
"I drink a couple of cups of strong black coffee every day but rarely a fancy drink from a cafe.  This product is convenient- you can just put it in the refrigerator or open the can and pour it over ice - or both. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It has plenty of caffeine and the right amount of milk and sugar.  I have had a very similar product from Starbucks and I really don't sense much of a difference between the two. I would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time. Again, this product and the product from Starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality.",coffee
"I love this coffee. I've been drinking Eight O'Clock for years until I tried Cameron's Southern Pecan, which is much better. It has a definite nutty flavor, the pecan flavor itself more subtle, but definitely detectable. A little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right. I find that 2 level tablespoons to 6 oz. of water is about right, but I make mine slightly stronger. Anything less than 2 tablespoons to 6 oz. and it'll taste like average store-bought. It's just got a wonderful warm flavor. I just make enough for 2 cups in the morning, grinding enough beans for 3 days so it doesn't lose flavor. Great stuff!",coffee
"Very clean and light. 0 calories.  I've only used it in coffee, but it would probably be good over ice cream too. My friend joked you could put it in the bath, but I think that actually might be a good idea. Haven't tried it yet, but since it's made with Splends, not sugar, you probably could get a nice peppermint bath!  Haha. Weird. As a coffee flavor it is very nice!  By the way, the bottles are plastic, not glass, in case you were wondering.",coffee
"I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.  I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.",coffee
"These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.  I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles"".",ingredients
"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon.",ingredients
"I gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which I gave it to her (a Foie Gras dish). But I must say this price for a French truffle is amazing. I suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the $300 truffles. Good for those of you who do. But for the rest of us, this is a good choice. Linda Morse",ingredients
"This is the brand I normally buy, but the price on Amazon is less than half of supermarket price.  I bake bread all the time, and the expiration date on these is February, 2013. Will buy again. Thanks Amazon for a very good deal.",ingredients
"Thanks for the speedy shipping, got the products right on time. Very high quality Maple syrup, I will definitely buy Coombs brand Maple syrup from Amazon again.",ingredients
"A warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people. There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem.",ingredients
tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.  it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape,ingredients
"I actually tasted the Berry/Vanilla flavor.  If you've ever eaten a fig newton, then try to imagine a fig newton, minus the fig center, with rice crispies mixed up in it.  It tastes a little grainy at first, but once I read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice, I was more at ease.  Really a good taste.  One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.",ingredients
This is a tad better to me than the Mojito flavor. It's final mix is a translucent green. It's not too sweet but doesn't have that totally artificial-tasting twang to it either. I would definitely buy on my own.,drinks
"Expensive but so far is the best green tea I could find. Coconut green is my favorite flavor, amazing. I will definitely order more.",drinks
This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas. I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my (orange juice based) smoothie in the morning - it adds a nice hint of mint.  I recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea - this tea goes very well with orange juice.,drinks
The dried fruit are very tasty. The individual pkgs are handy and convenient. Great for people on the go. I recommend this product.,drinks
These taste great.  I add 1 or 2 cubes to the water when cooking quinoa or lentils and it really adds a nice depth of flavor.  I use them often.,drinks
"I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.  Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.  It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.  Try the Kiwi Berry instead.",drinks
"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE.",drinks
Gives popcorn a pleasing color and lets the corn pop fully. I have been very satisfied. I will purchase more of this.,drinks

"This is my family's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. This brand is moist, tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to. Namaste products are the best in my opinion of what's available out there in health food stores. Try it! You won't be disappointed.",baking_dessert
"I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?",baking_dessert
"Had a box of their garlic sticks, and really enjoyed the quality and satisfying feeling from eating them. Wanted to try a new flavor, and the sesame is quite addicting!! Only 2 Weight Watchers points for 4 incredible sticks. These are made in Italy. Expect many of the breadsticks to be broken, but don't let this stop you from trying this premium brand!",baking_dessert

"I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes.",baking_dessert
Caused a fight over who was getting what lol. Perfect gift and have told many others to check out this box and the others they have available. Very quick delivery,baking_dessert
"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.  The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.  Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.",dog_cat
"The dogs loved them, I'll certainly order these again.  They're wholesome and not made in China which is very important",dog_cat
We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,dog_cat
"High quality dog food, I feed lamb as it is easier on their disgestion, I highly recommend this if you have small dogs..",dog_cat
"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!",dog_cat
MADE IN CHINA.. Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor. Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....,dog_cat
"My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.  I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.  According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from ""minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients.""  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.",dog_cat
"My dog, Ace, loves these treats. I love them because I can throw a handful in my pocket to take along on one of Ace's walks without them staining or making my pocket sticky. The coating on the treats is great for those of us that don't want to bother with plastic baggies. My dog learned most of his tricks using these treats as a reward.",dog_cat
"First, you can either soak or spray this product.  If you're lazy like I am you can put it in a spray bottle, spray your produce in a colander in the sink, and rinse a bit later. I've never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way (with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples & the wax turns whiter & starts to chip off).  When I've used the soak method, I've seen the dirty water after, so I do feel like this does a nice cleaning job.  I love this stuff and many grocery chains don't carry it reliably, so it's great that Amazon has it!",snacks_water

"I have tried lots of different protein bars but the main problem is always the same, they taste like protein bars.

"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers.",snacks_water
I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to.,snacks_water
"FOR A NON-ORGANIC OR NON-GOURMET ITEM THIS TASTES AMAZINGLY FRESH, CRUNCHY AND YUMMY. BEWARE: CALORIE COUNT, FAT AND SALT CONTENT IS CONSIDERABLE.

"It is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water.  Make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out.  It was a little hard to use my fingers to eat.  I bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking.  It is light weight, healthy, and fulfilling as a part of my lunch.  The calorie count is good (80 per packet) and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel.  I can also see it being added into rehydrated TVP, rehydrated instant refried beans, and canned soup, etc..  I also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry.  it's a super healthy snack (if u prefer savory snack).  Overall I am very happy to have it in my pantry so that I can grab it whenever i need one or two.",snacks_water
"These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.",grocery

"2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009 By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",grocery
"These lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers/lollipops.  My children and I are very happy with the taste of these.

"With the exception of home-made, these are my favorite egg noodles. They always cook up just right -- firm and tasty. I got them on an Amazon Warehouse deal so the price was better than getting them at a warehouse club (and far better than the grocery store). These are the medium ones which are pretty narrow in size. Good for adding to soups, casseroles, or just tossing with some butter and veggies.  Came well packed with no discernable breakage in the packages.",grocery
"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables.

"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning.",mains_spread

"These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!",chips_corn
"We tend to eat these straight and/or with hummus as a chip substitute. I've noticed some variation between packages in the texture of the crisps. I prefer them when they're a bit firmer, but they're still nice even when they're softer than I would like.",chips_corn
