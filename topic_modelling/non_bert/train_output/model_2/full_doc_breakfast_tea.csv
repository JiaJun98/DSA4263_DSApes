26,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.  But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate.","['choice', 'tea', 'company', 'pioneer', 'use', 'trade', 'ingredient', 'tea', 'choice', 'design', 'ingredient', 'combination', 'design', 'choice', 'line', 'tea', 'bag', 'use', 'tea', 'ingredient', 'combination', 'tea', 'marriage', 'lychee', 'flavor', 'osmanthus', 'flavor', 'scent']",0
56,"Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.

60,"I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend.","['oreo', 'fudge', 'one', 'favorite', 'mint', 'peanut', 'butter', 'version', 'peanut', 'butter', 'mint', 'kid', 'boy', 'girl', 'cooky', 'mind', 'sign', 'kid', 'disappointment', 'cookie', 'half', 'cost', 'oreo', 'time', 'cookie', 'way', 'cookie']",0
65,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again....

207,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.  So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.  This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.  Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]  Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those ""You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone"" sorts of things, I guess.

209,I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.

Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem.

The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

1813,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.  Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).  Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.  I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.  I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.  Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.

3500,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.  White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.  I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).","['state', 'tea', 'tea', 'tea', 'favorite', 'lookout', 'bai', 'mudan', 'bai', 'hao', 'yinzhen', 'volume', 'tea', 'price', 'surprise', 'layer', 'tea', 'tea', 'tin', 'leaf', 'filter', 'screen', 'tea', 'tea', 'screen', 'bag', 'point', 'chance', 'bag', 'batch', 'point', 'leaf', 'bit', 'tea', 'tea', 'basis', 'bag', 'couple', 'pic', 'mind', 'pouch', 'tin', 'picture', 'tin']",0

I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.  The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.  Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)  I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.

4024,"My first meal replacement was Slim Fast, unfortunatly it didn't work for me. Before I decided to try this product, I did some research. This is a good protein shake. It has 180 calories and 30g of protein! Low sugar compare to other drinks. I drink it once/day after a 1 hour workout for five days a week. The chocolate tastes great. No need to add the extras like ice, juices, or fruits for better taste. Instantly stopped my hunger for a couple of hours. Gives me a good amount of energy. Not gassy! The packets are great for traveling. UPDATE - 3/10/11 So far, chocolate it the best flavor. Vanilla tastes like lite sweet milk.

4040,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.","['friend', 'living', 'usa', 'baby', 'impression', 'husband', 'present', 'clothing', 'flower', 'rose', 'supplier', 'spring', 'air', 'rose', 'farm', 'colombia', 'fedex', 'order', 'inventory', 'warehouse', 'usa', 'rose', 'week', 'rose', 'addition', 'price', 'bet', 'try', 'result', 'expectation', 'bar', 'communication', 'seller', 'instruction', 'life', 'flower', 'rose', 'fedex', 'seller', 'change', 'card', 'request', 'weekend', 'hour', 'phone', 'friend', 'family', 'rose', 'rose', 'plan', 'spring', 'air', 'job', 'service', 'rose']",0
4042,This is probably the best tea I have had and this brand is always a winner.  So far I am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while I am experimenting looking for my perfect taste I have found it to be great weak or strong.  Depending on my mood I like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used.  My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.  They usually claim it is too strong with how much I use but for me it is perfect.

I agree with the other reviewer that the price is high for shipping. In my area I could not find it in the Asian stores so I have to order it. For three bags the shipping was just $1.50 more than the shipping for one bag so I bought three to offset the shipping cost. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the tea should be brewed very strongly then add water or milk to it later. I love the tea hot or cold with or without cream.

4211,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.  By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant.
