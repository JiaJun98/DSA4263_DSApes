"For a low gluten product this stuff is very good.  It holds up well in liquid, doesn't get all mushy. I like the bits of dried fruit.  I add stevia for sweetness.",snacks
"This is one of my all-time favorite candies.  Lays used to have a slogan, ""Bet you can't eat just one!"" and there's no doubt, for me, that's the case with these.  My biggest 'problem' with these is I can't leave them alone and my waistline is suggesting I SHOULD!",snacks
"These bars are a tasty snack.  The taste is like a dry carrot cake.  It is a little chewy, and has a nice texture, with nuts and raisins.  It is surprisingly high in calories, 180 for each bar.",snacks
These are fantastic. Better than regular pretzels. I was expecting them to be hard and grainy like everything else GF but they were not. They are made with potato and corn starch instead of rice flour. Seriously. These are really good!,carbs
"I've been gluten-free for a little over a year and I've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. The great thing about this mix is that it's really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating them--saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. If they didn't see me eating them, I don't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten-free pancakes.",carbs
These chocolate chips taste great and have a creamy texture. Even when meltling the consistancy is creamy and yummy.  I use them for baking gluten free cookies and breads.,carbs
"The juniper plant I received died within a month of planting.<br />After I did some research, I found that it does the best outside of the home, which Eve's Garden failed to mention in the product instructions.<br />I gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted. I will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again.",package_dog
"These breadsticks were wonderful with hummus and spinach dip. Wonderfully light and crisp with just a hint of herbs. I'll also add addicting! I rated it only a 4 star because the shipping was careless. Half the boxes contained broken breadsticks and I really wanted to serve them upright. Hopefully, Amazon will take note and ship with padding next time.",package_dog
"My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste.",package_dog
"This is my first Manuka honey and I must say that it tastes very nice.<br /><br />Toast a slice of bread (e.g., Arnold's Ancient Grains)<br />Spread honey<br />Spread peanut butter<br /><br />Enjoy!",spread
"FantasiCakes sent my cake FAST, and it was also sent MOIST!!  For me it's hard to go wrong with chocolate, but this cake really is fantastic! The icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure. I really liked that because I don't normally like a lot of icing. LOVE IT!",spread
I make bread all the time & always look for variety...this bread is tasty & delicious! I have a two loaf bread machine and my husband kids favorite is this one!,spread
"I bought this Hazelnut Paste (Nocciola Spread) at a local shop in Palm Cost, Florida. The taste is excellent and healthier than Nutella.",products
this product has a kick to it which you cant usually find<br />with other hot mustard brands but pay attention the jars are very small,products
I now will never run out of food for my cats.  They both love it every time and I love the price.,products
was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds...,cooking stuff
"Tasty, spicy, and good. Became quite the conversation piece at work. No one have ever  heard of microwave pork rinds before. They tasted them and love them. Only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook.",cooking stuff
"Lowrey's has changed it's microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product. I will buy no more Lowrey's microwave pork rinds.",cooking stuff
I love this tea! My wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my Keurig I have to say I LOVE it. I didn't purchase through amazon though because I got the same amount 24 in a box for only 9.99 elsewhere but I would recommend it to anyone.,drinks
"Roasted to city/city+ and it is excellent.  Brewed in a french press, very aromatic while brewing, smooth flavor, some fruity tones.  I'll have to try some of the other green coffees from these folks, but will definitely purchase these again.",drinks
"I have never used a coffee syrup but love Starbucks and though why not see how close I can get to that wonderful taste,,,I used this Torani Hazelnut Syrup just a small amount in most of my different flavors coffee it is sweet so you don't need any added sugar...Good price, shipping was high but would buy again, might try a different flavor...",drinks
"Little lesson on TRUFFLES...<br />Truffles graded ""Extra"" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked ""brushed"" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.<br /><br />Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle ""look"", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.<br />NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example ""JR Mushrooms & Specialties"" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",snacks_2
"I recently tried the Quaker Banana Nut Bread cereal bar and was pleasantly surprised.  From first bite, I felt like I was really eating banana nut bread and it was simply delicious!",snacks_2
"I purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch.  The texture is a bit hard (moat if not all protein bars are hard) but these Special K Protein Bars tastes great!  With 10 grams of protein per bar, it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there.  I only have other protein bars that I use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these Special K bars tastes the best to me.  I will be buying more!",snacks_2
I have been a licorice lover all my life and black licorice laces are my favorite type of licorice.  This product has been impossible to find where I live.  I have searched every store around but no store supplies black licorice laces.  After finding it on Amazon I ordered it immediately but I was very dissatisfied with the taste of Gustaf's licorice.  It didnt taste like the real black licorice but some artificial substitute and it was way too soft.  It didn't please me any more than the Twizzlers do.  It's just not a real licorice flavor.  I would never order Gustaf's licorice again.,flavor
I bought my first RJ's soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice I have ever tasted!!,flavor
licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice,flavor
"I dont know if I believe this tea is helpful for losing weight, but it tastes great and its a wonderful alternative to soda...which is the reason I bought it.",sweet drinks
This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.,sweet drinks
"This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.<br /><br />It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:<br /><br />Vitamin C - 120%<br />Vitamin B6 - 40%<br />Vitamin B5 - 40%<br />Vitamin B3 - 40%<br />Vitamin B12 - 40%<br />Zinc - 10%<br />Chromium - 10%<br /><br />The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it.",sweet drinks
