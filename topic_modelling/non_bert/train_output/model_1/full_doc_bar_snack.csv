60,"I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend.","['oreo', 'fudge', 'one', 'favorite', 'mint', 'peanut', 'butter', 'version', 'peanut', 'butter', 'mint', 'kid', 'boy', 'girl', 'cooky', 'mind', 'sign', 'kid', 'disappointment', 'cookie', 'half', 'cost', 'oreo', 'time', 'cookie', 'way', 'cookie']",9
65,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again....

92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.","['lot', 'cereal', 'lot', 'kind', 'mini', 'wheat', 'raisin', 'bran', 'instance', 'healthier', 'option', 'kashi', 'cereal', 'plain', 'grape', 'nut', 'yeast', 'food', 'litter', 'texture', 'antioxidant', 'berry', 'yogurt', 'crunch', 'cereal', 'health', 'bar', 'cereal', 'cluster', 'yogurt', 'plain', 'cereal', 'yes', 'sugar', 'fiber', 'calorie', 'part', 'bran', 'wheat', 'sugar', 'calorie', 'antioxidant', 'bonus', 'line', 'list', 'sale', 'price']",9

122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.

There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called ""cookies"" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!  Sulfur gives me hives anyway.  As of right now, these are $18.22 per package for 4 packages of 10 servings each.  I'm hoping these become subscribe & save items.

We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie.

I was pleasantly suprized when I served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn't the real thing. I'm glad I ordered such a large quantity. I will be using this from now one.

The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.  On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.  When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.  I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet.

Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.

I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa.","['birthday', 'money', 'family', 'couple', 'goody', 'cocoa', 'chocolate', 'one', 'review', 'water', 'thickness', 'raspberry', 'hershey', 'chocolate', 'spoonful', 'cobblestone', 'kitchen', 'cocoa', 'boost', 'test', 'plan', 'can', 'time', 'stir', 'cocoa']",9

1394,"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.  Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.  Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.  But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.

I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.

The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that.  It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped.  The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness.  What else can really be said about an Oreo?

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.  As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.  I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.  I really want to like this company.

If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer.

I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.

3599,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.  300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.  I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.  The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.  Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)  I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.  UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything.","['breakfast', 'cookie', 'flavor', 'depth', 'spice', 'texture', 'calorie', 'bit', 'glass', 'water', 'hour', 'tummy', 'ingredient', 'pinch', 'toddler', 'daughter', 'oatmeal', 'morning', 'fruit', 'yogurt', 'breakfast', 'cooky', 'morning', 'time', 'opportunity', 'problem', 'protein', 'bar', 'hour', 'snack', 'lunch', 'problem', 'breakfast', 'cookie', 'calorie', 'kitchen', 'thing', 'chip', 'cookie', 'heat', 'purse', 'diaper', 'bag', 'mess', 'freezer', 'freshness', 'saucer', 'nuke', 'second', 'warm', 'oven', 'fridge', 'good', 'bread', 'pound', 'change', 'cooky', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'matter', 'lunchtime', 'time']",9

I am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and I didn't feel like I was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients. The mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over-sweetened snack bars.

It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.

4185,"The Tanka Bars I purchased were moist, solid, tasty without too much salt or sweetener, and a small amount alleviated hunger for several hours at a time. As I diabetic type II I often have hunger pangs throughout the day. Pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift. This helped me maintain a steady blood glucose level all day. A little bit goes a long way so it should not be gobbled like an energy bar. The taste will tempt you to do so. It is pricey, but certainly worth it.

4277,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.","['problem', 'peanut', 'butter', 'use', 'cane', 'juice', 'way', 'sugar', 'accent', 'sugar', 'sugar', 'peanut', 'maple', 'cane', 'juice', 'moisture', 'content', 'peanut', 'butter', 'loser', 'hype', 'peanut', 'butter', 'peanut', 'butter', 'sandwich', 'restaurant', 'york', 'pbj', 'celery', 'pb', 'tablespoon', 'peanut', 'butter', 'snack', 'food', 'intake', 'peanut', 'butter', 'taste', 'star', 'confection', 'cooky', 'peanut', 'butter', 'way', 'taste']",9
