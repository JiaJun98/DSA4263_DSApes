7,"I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.  I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste.

I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie.

131,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW  Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?  Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!  The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.  ~ Ana Mardoll","['pasta', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'parma', 'rosa', 'creamy', 'tomato', 'incredible', 'pasta', 'mix', 'love', 'sauce', 'pasta', 'higher-fat', 'alfredo', 'sauce', 'cheese', 'sauce', 'acidic', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'acid', 'reflux', 'spaghetti', 'meatball', 'life', 'eh', 'sauce', 'aisle', 'knorr', 'alfredo', 'packet', 'parma', 'rosa', 'sauce', 'idea', 'sauce', 'reviewer', 'creamy', 'tomato', 'alfredo', 'creamy', 'light', 'tomato', 'exquisite', 'acid', 'content', 'low', 'stomach', 'wonderful', 'impulse', 'eating', 'parma', 'rosa', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'easy', 'instruction', 'milk', 'powdered', 'mix', 'packet', 'reason', 'packet', 'smaller', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'versus', 'jar', 'mean', 'price', 'local', 'market', 'parma', 'rosa', 'pound', 'seasoned', 'ground', 'beef', 'easy', 'portion', 'meal', 'sauce', 'packet', 'sauce', 'store', 'fridge', 'person', 'leftover', 'mardoll']",8

527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor.

One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.  Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.

Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.

927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.","['sort', 'thing', 'rare', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'brand', 'doubt', 'main', 'competitor', 'better', 'mixed', 'almost-cheese', 'sauce', 'milk', 'toss-up', 'term', 'nutrition', 'nutritional', 'champ', 'prepared', 'calorie', 'calorie', 'mg', 'sodium', 'kraft', 'velveeta', 'cheesy', 'skillet', 'overall', 'protein', 'g', 'g', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'g', 'gram', 'competitor', 'difference', 'attributable', 'cheese', 'sauce', 'edge', 'total', 'fat', 'g', 'ground', 'beef', 'difference', 'daily', 'fat', 'significant', 'brand', 'transfat', 'list', 'oil', 'ingredient', 'half-gram', 'disclosure', 'package', 'cup', 'dinner', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'g', 'transfat', 'saturated', 'fat', 'ground', 'beef', 'gram', 'sodium', 'meal', 'daily', 'value', 'sodium', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'definition', 'sound', 'choice', 'case', 'thing', 'price', 'availability', 'equal']",8

I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.

1064,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both.

1714,"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.  I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS.

1775,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.

2050,"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.  Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.","['mom', 'discount', 'cheaper', 'store', 'sale', 'sale', 'kroger', 'publix', 'grocery', 'store', 'cent', 'jar', 'earth', 'best', 'fruit', 'variety', 'available', 'price', 'problem', 'breakage', 'packaging', 'general', 'earth', 'brand', 'price', 'fair', 'organic', 'non-gmo', 'baby', 'food', 'door', 'step', 'single', 'mom', 'rural', 'community', 'grocery', 'store', 'baby', 'hassle', 'earth', 'best', 'tasting', 'non-organic', 'food', 'texture', 'food', 'longer', 'month', 'texture', 'food', 'son', 'gag', 'similar', 'issue', 'food', 'food', 'food', 'best', 'freshness', 'aroma', 'pureed', 'fresh', 'produce', 'winn-dixie', 'price', 'earth', 'expensive', 'selection', 'flavor', 'limited', 'store', 'online', 'organic', 'baby', 'food', 'jar', 'earth', 'best', 'pinch']",8

My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?

It is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses, especially when purchased on subscription basis.

I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me.

The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.

Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.

I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.  I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.

I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.

3274,"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.  Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.  I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.  The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]  When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)  Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.  The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.  I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee.","['ghee', 'indulgence', 'ghee', 'essential', 'vitamin', 'supplement', 'ghee', 'necessary', 'vegetarian', 'diet', 'opinion', 'healthy', 'addition', 'diet', 'research', 'ghee', 'cholesterol', 'extensive', 'survey', 'ghee', 'product', 'available', 'value', 'ghee', 'important', 'addition', 'diet', 'small', 'ghee', 'need', 'ghee', 'comparison', 'table', 'blog', 'link', 'comment', 'ghee', 'comparison', 'interested', 'best', 'value', 'organic', 'ghee', 'product', 'product', 'organic', 'standard', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'high', 'ghee', 'product', 'available', 'pick', 'available', 'grass', 'organic', 'ghee', 'pick', 'high', 'ghee', 'available', 'authentic', 'ghee', 'authentic', 'information', 'table', 'link', 'fact', 'focus', 'evaluation', 'gourmet', 'optimum', 'health', 'ghee', 'healthiest', 'grass', 'fed', 'organic', 'ghee', 'best', 'product', 'grass', 'organic', 'ghee', 'accord', 'ancient', 'tradition', 'phase', 'moon', 'price', 'value', 'ghee']",8

I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one.

As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating. The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.","['candy-lover', 'cute', 'bag', 'purpose', 'star', 'however-', 'lollipop', 'minute', 'unbearable', 'way', 'bit', 'review', 'outraged', 'individual', 'lollipop', ""china'-"", 'text', 'wrapper', 'fine-', 'share', 'presentation', 'color', 'vivid', 'picture', 'lolipops', 'glazed-', 'shiny', 'well-wrapped', 'happy', 'purchase', 'plan', 'share', 'friend', 'different', 'time']",8

And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece.

Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator. Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.

4040,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again.

4212,"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.  I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).  Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.  I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.  If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.","['march', 'pleased', 'coconut', 'milk', 'coconut', 'milk', 'creamy', 'layer', 'cream', 'case', 'end', 'subscription', 'plan', 'roland', 'coconut', 'new', 'case', 'content', 'can', 'time', 'coconut', 'milk', 'watery', 'flavor', 'fond', 'layer', 'cream', 'thinner', 'consistency', 'product', 'roland', 'organic', 'coconut', 'milk', 'slight', 'difference', 'can', 'thicker', 'non-subscription', 'can', 'australian', 'organic', 'copyright', 'thailand', 'watery', 'subscription', 'klbd', 'symbol', 'control', 'union', 'certification', 'copyright', 'sri', 'can', 'ingredient', 'nutrition', 'information', 'problem', 'packaging', 'non-subscription', 'minor', 'dent', 'can', 'packaging', 'subscription', 'mess', 'box', 'box', 'can', 'hole', 'result', 'fall', 'condition', 'lack', 'consistency', 'poor', 'flavor', 'star', 'review']",8

And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...","['similar', 'trader', 'joe', 'tj', 'readily-available', 'variation', 'thing', 'starter', 'packaging', 'thing', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'kind', 'big', 'carton', 'container', 'noodle', 'various', 'seasoning', 'water', 'line', 'kind', 'awkward', 'minute', 'minute', 'trader', 'joe', 'packet', 'noodle', 'sauce', 'water', 'minute', 'lot', 'tastier', 'texture', 'thing', 'different', 'packet', 'time', 'couple', 'brand', 'thing']",8
4352,"I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy. If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don't order these.  Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global. They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa. Very adult and superb.","['chocolate', 'level', 'crispness', 'nut', 'chewy', 'crunchy', 'chocolate', 'coating', 'bit', 'mealy', 'dark', 'chocolate', 'snap', 'best', 'dark', 'chocolate', 'walnut', 'perigord', 'available', 'canadian', 'company', 'ki', 'global', 'sun', 'dried', 'super', 'crispy', 'shell', 'dark', 'chocolate', 'unsweetened', 'cocoa']",8
