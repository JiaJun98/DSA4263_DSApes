15,I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund. I was very please with the seller's response.,"['healthy', 'treat', 'dog', 'box', 'box', 'way', 'treat', 'hole', 'plastic', 'outside', 'evidence', 'date', 'couple', 'month', 'people', 'time', 'refund', 'seller', 'response']",7

104,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.  I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.  Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!  Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)  Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.","['doggie', 'newman', 'dog', 'food', 'pet', 'big-box', 'store', 'budget', 'newman', 'organic', 'harmony', 'farm', 'compromise', 'doggie', 'budget', 'happy', 'high', 'food', 'food', 'trash', 'egg', 'shell', 'bone', 'void', 'barfing', 'digestion', 'problem', 'accident', 'high', 'food', 'mean', 'digestion', 'shiny', 'coat', 'high', 'energy', 'bright', 'eye', 'attitude', 'ton', 'additional', 'elixers', 'treat', 'vet', 'bill', 'definite', 'cost', 'effective', 'win', 'win', 'doggie', 'result', 'newman', 'dog', 'food', 'price', 'psst', 'organic', 'fanatic', 'nutritional', 'value', 'fur', 'baby', 'human', 'kid', 'update', 'buck', 'newman', 'organic', 'cost', 'pound', 'dog', 'harmony', 'newman', 'budget', 'cost', 'effective', 'time', 'purchase', 'update', 'batch', 'harmony', 'farm', 'rancid', 'oil', 'smell', 'bag', 'pooch', 'past', 'trash', 'pouch', 'food', 'brown', 'rice', 'mix-ins', 'pricey', 'sure', 'home', 'texas', 'heat', 'customer', 'service', 'replacement', 'issue', 'hot', 'weather', 'hot', 'weather', 'alternative']",7
105,"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them.

221,"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs!

358,"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.","['sojo', 'meat', 'mix', 'raw', 'dog', 'coccidia', 'giardia', 'puppy', 'veterinary', 'mismanagement', 'healthy', 'year', 'life', 'sicker', 'aggressive', 'course', 'antibiotic', 'prednisone', 'inflammatory', 'bowel', 'disease', 'holistic', 'veterinarian', 'treatment', 'homemade', 'diet', 'sojo', 'meat', 'medication', 'pleased', 'gi', 'month', 'point', 'healthy', 'coat', 'glossy', 'fluffier', 'weight', 'photo', 'dramatic', 'improvement', 'credit', 'extra', 'time', 'opposed', 'day', 'worth', 'time', 'minute', 'total', 'time', 'meat', 'honest', 'dog', 'result', 'able', 'road', 'vet', 'ok', 'preparation', 'time']",7

I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.

840,We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results.

Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have.

Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.

So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.

FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]","['package', 'price', 'refund', 'trash', 'fda', 'web', 'site', 'fda', 'dog', 'owner', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'product', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'fda', 'consumer', 'jerky', 'product', 'dog', 'chicken', 'tender', 'treat', 'illness', 'dog', 'month', 'fda', 'increase', 'number', 'complaint', 'dog', 'illness', 'consumption', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'product', 'china', 'complaint', 'dog', 'owner', 'veterinarian', 'cautionary', 'warning', 'jerky', 'product', 'consumer', 'september', 'preliminary', 'animal', 'health', 'notification', 'december', 'number', 'complaint', 'drop', 'fda', 'number', 'complaint', 'rise', 'level', 'concern', 'release', 'earlier', 'warning', 'jerky', 'product', 'balanced', 'diet', 'small', 'quantity', 'consumer', 'dog', 'jerky', 'product', 'dog', 'following', 'sign', 'hour', 'day', 'product', 'decreased', 'activity', 'diarrhea', 'blood', 'increased', 'water', 'consumption', 'urination', 'dog', 'sign', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'owner', 'veterinarian', 'sign', 'severe', 'persist', 'hour', 'blood', 'test', 'kidney', 'failure', 'urea', 'nitrogen', 'creatinine', 'urine', 'test', 'fanconi', 'syndrome', 'glucose', 'dog', 'report', 'fda', 'dog', 'fda', 'addition', 'animal', 'health', 'diagnostic', 'laboratory', 'product', 'illness', 'dog', 'veterinary', 'laboratory', 'response', 'network', 'vlrn', 'available', 'animal', 'health', 'diagnostic', 'laboratory', 'date', 'scientist', 'able', 'definitive', 'cause', 'reported', 'illness', 'extensive', 'chemical', 'microbial', 'testing', 'contaminant', 'fda', 'problem', 'origin', 'illness', 'result', 'cause', 'chicken', 'jerky', 'veterinarian', 'consumer', 'case', 'animal', 'illness', 'pet', 'food', 'fda', 'consumer', 'complaint', 'coordinator', 'state']",7

I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs.

Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

3672,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.   Karl and Lori  Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.","['letter', 'considerable', 'thought', 'friday', 'morning', 'february', 'scream', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'lori', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'greta', 'year-old', 'registered', 'female', 'pug', 'greta', 'coffee', 'table', 'death', 'purina', 'busy', 'bone', 'company', 'iconic', 'betty', 'crocker', 'bayer', 'gerber', 'general', 'mill', 'lethal', 'internet', 'issue', 'death', 'dog', 'time', 'dangerous', 'item', 'shelf', 'years-old', 'trust', 'purina', 'product', 'child', 'greta', 'breeder', 'adorable', 'puppy', 'fall', 'dead', 'lori', 'sweetheart', 'year', 'stroke', 'victim', 'kind', 'stressful', 'catastrophe', 'animal', 'lover', 'heart', 'torn', 'asunder', 'angry', 'united', 'citizen', 'pet', 'child', 'familiar', 'westminster', 'kennel', 'club', 'dog', 'series', 'world', 'finest', 'breed', 'competition', 'best', 'chinese', 'pug', 'idea', 'loss', 'negligent', 'hand', 'money', 'greta', 'breeder', 'spayed', 'beloved', 'pet', 'companion', 'regular', 'check-ups', 'shot', 'veterinary', 'office', 'distance', 'kroger', 'store', 'busy', 'bone', 'year-old', 'father', 'week', 'time', 'visit', 'fulltime', 'companion', 'jack', 'russell', 'terrier', 'spencer', 'disabled', 'us', 'walker', 'heart-valve', 'replacement', 'surgery', 'cleveland', 'clinic', 'myriad', 'health', 'issue', 'care', 'dog', 'loving', 'attention', 'spencer', 'dad', 'alive', 'today', 'dog', 'special', 'gift', 'life', 'purina', 'purina', 'consideration', 'welfare', 'dog', 'country', 'disabled', 'year-old', 'man', 'case', 'male', 'pug', 'winston', 'tenacious', 'bulldog', 'feature', 'amazing', 'face', 'winston', 'winston', 'greta', 'individual', 'soulful', 'companion', 'playmate', 'professional', 'photographer', 'writer', 'trade', 'work', 'general', 'public', 'confidence', 'writing', 'nature', 'certain', 'state', 'mind', 'result', 'greta', 'busy', 'bone', 'short', 'guilt', 'grief', 'tragic', 'memory', 'lifetime', 'thing', 'worse', 'case', 'greta', 'death', 'winston', 'greta', 'busy', 'bone', 'time', 'past', 'greta', 'smaller', 'portion', 'time', 'careful', 'observation', 'problem', 'retrospect', 'concern', 'potential', 'danger', 'brief', 'moment', 'room', 'greta', 'hazard', 'conduct', 'adequate', 'safety', 'research', 'store', 'answer', 'self-evident', 'gross', 'negligence', 'negligence', 'death', 'greta', 'dog', 'mark', 'lori', 'life', 'able', 'painful', 'image', 'mind', 'lying', 'floor', 'awake', 'night', 'grave', 'backyard', 'anguish', 'writer', 'word', 'closest', 'special', 'friend', 'utterly', 'distraught', 'greta', 'years-old', 'healthy', 'prime', 'wonderful', 'loving', 'companion', 'horrid', 'loss', 'thanks', 'purina', 'form', 'busy', 'bone', 'market', 'adequate', 'responsible', 'research', 'future', 'purina', 'karl', 'owner', 'beloved', 'greta', 'female', 'baby']",7

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.
