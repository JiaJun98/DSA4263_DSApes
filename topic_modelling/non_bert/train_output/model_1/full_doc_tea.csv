26,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.  But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate.","['choice', 'tea', 'company', 'pioneer', 'use', 'trade', 'ingredient', 'tea', 'choice', 'design', 'ingredient', 'combination', 'design', 'choice', 'line', 'tea', 'bag', 'use', 'tea', 'ingredient', 'combination', 'tea', 'marriage', 'lychee', 'flavor', 'osmanthus', 'flavor', 'scent']",2

75,I love the strength and taste of PG Tips.

96,"I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesn't have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World.","['homemade', 'vanilla', 'recipe', 'line', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'sonoma', 'spicy', 'world', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'sonoma', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'sonoma', 'pint', 'vodka', 'vanilla', 'month', 'spicy', 'world', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'pint', 'vodka', 'month', 'liquid', 'tea', 'aroma', 'alcohol', 'bean', 'result', 'vanilla', 'vanilla', 'aroma', 'vanilla', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'spicy', 'world', 'waste', 'money', 'spicy', 'world']",2

143,"I've been fan of celestial seasonings teas for some time and this is one of my favorites.

195,We have been paying big bucks for little cans of Rooibos tea at the health food store and brewing ice tea with it that we drink by the gallon.

201,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor.

203,"This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!

207,"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.  So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.  This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.  Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]  Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those ""You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone"" sorts of things, I guess.

209,I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.  The peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the English Breakfast Tea made me a fan of that flavor where I never had been before.

The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

1813,"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.  Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).  Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.  I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.  I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.  Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.

There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.  The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.

3500,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.  White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.  I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).","['state', 'tea', 'tea', 'tea', 'favorite', 'lookout', 'bai', 'mudan', 'bai', 'hao', 'yinzhen', 'volume', 'tea', 'price', 'surprise', 'layer', 'tea', 'tea', 'tin', 'leaf', 'filter', 'screen', 'tea', 'tea', 'screen', 'bag', 'point', 'chance', 'bag', 'batch', 'point', 'leaf', 'bit', 'tea', 'tea', 'basis', 'bag', 'couple', 'pic', 'mind', 'pouch', 'tin', 'picture', 'tin']",2

It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.  It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,  If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.  Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were.

4211,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.

4305,I have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers.  Although I did not find this the best version of Earl Grey out there it was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  For a system that can provide me with Tea at a moments notice I am quite pleased.  You can't expect something that provides you convenience like the Tassimo to produce the same results as hand brewing from a tea bag or leaves.,"['reviewer', 'version', 'earl', 'grey', 'tea', 'moment', 'notice', 'tassimo', 'result', 'hand', 'brewing', 'tea', 'bag', 'leaf']",2
4316,I bought this product as a gift for my son who is away at college. He liked the tea and enjoyed having a varity to pick from. I will re-order this again. Two thumbs up!,"['gift', 'son', 'college', 'tea', 'varity', 'thumb']",2
4321,"The product is so versatile and flavorful. I use it to make instant ginger tea, also to cook Asian style dishes or bake delicious cookies. I trust Frontier, they always carry high quality products, non irradiated and sulfur-free.","['ginger', 'tea', 'style', 'dish', 'cooky', 'frontier', 'product']",2
4342,"I grew up with Lipton tea, so maybe at 67 I'm addicted. I love the taste and how it does not get bitter if I leave the teabag in too long.","['lipton', 'tea', 'teabag']",2
4347,"I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, Chai tea and this tea is a nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle. I've had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere.","['tea', 'drinker', 'coffee', 'tea', 'earl', 'grey', 'chai', 'tea', 'tea', 'addition', 'thing', 'point', 'question', 'oolong', 'flavor', 'touch', 'sweetener', 'taste', 'bit', 'flavor', 'middle', 'problem', 'bag', 'leaf', 'dust']",2
