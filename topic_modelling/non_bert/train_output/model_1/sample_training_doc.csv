"This was quite yummy (I tried it) and also is nice and thick to help older babies learn to eat food with more texture. My son preferred this to apple sauce, which is about half as thick as this.",unknown
I never liked the taste of the refried beans in a can. I tried these and they were just as good as the kind you get in a mexican food restaurant. Melt some cheese on top.  I just ordered two of the cases of 8 each.,unknown
"It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much.",unknown
The taste is very good! Oat bran is much more creamy than one-minute quick oat (it just doesn't tastes like oat...). A perfect food for somebody on diet. Just one single tablespoon of oat bran would make you feel very full.,unknown
"Bold and tangy, the Taco Bell Spicy Ranchero Sauce is excellent.  We've used it with tacos and with flautas, and now there is none left in our sample bottle!  Everyone liked it, even those who normally don't care for spicy foods.  Off to the grocery for more!",unknown
"This is one of the easiest coconut oils to cook and bake with. The taste is not very strong so that you can cook non dessert like food with it as well.  I use it for almost everything. Food, skin, hair etc.",unknown
"Love this Sauce. Taste is perfect, I use this Sauce with so many food but mostly with macaroni cheese so Go for it. Best Sauce...!!!",unknown
"We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle. Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian. Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients. For an organic food it is affordable. Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control. Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a ""More Responsible Pet Food Company"" on several websites.",unknown
I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!,coffee
"I received my package today, ""FOG CHASER"" and was the first cup really good. Full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh....and no, i don't know or work for the company, just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys 6-8 boxes of K-cup coffee a month. I noticed NO sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe Kuerig a percentage....which drives up the price of all coffe in K-cups. IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.  I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie. I don't need to show off my coffee in a carousel, so this is just great to get a ""subscription discount"" for this good of a coffee that will fit my k-cup brewer.",coffee
"My husband and I both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste, but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have.  This Community Hazelnut has excellent flavor.  We make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee.",coffee
This is excellent coffee - a bit strong - which I personally like.  Price is good enough for this quality.,coffee
"Bad tasting coffee, no aroma/baked, very dry, bitter, hard, harsh and unpleasant aftertaste of burnt charcoal. Not suitable for espresso and not creamy at all.",coffee
"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.  Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!",coffee
"Overall, the product is fantastic and the coffee is great! I am giving a review of 4 stars only because Amazon's advertising is misleading, it does not come in the advertised box, as someone else indicated, it's an unmarked box with 3 smaller bags on the inside.  It is not a ""plastic K kup"", the product that you receive is what is pictured, with a filter type bottom. It does fit in your Keurig and brews just fine.  I love the aroma and the taste of this coffee, reminded my husband and I of espresso we had in Siily, Italy a few years ago.",coffee
"This is a poor excuse for coffee - even for instant coffee. I was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web - unfortunately, I was disappointed. I tried this coffee using the specified instructions, and also tried using less water. The best I can say of it is that it is weak garbage. It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee. If you want fast coffee, allow me to suggest a  Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System  instead.",coffee
"This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!  As with many food items sold on Amazon, I would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer (if you can find it) before committing to a whole six-pack. Once you know you like it, however, the value of this offering really can't be beat anywhere!",tea
"Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just can't get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so I'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it's bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*that's been pissed on in the woods).",tea
"I really love herbal tea, especially honey and vanilla. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it.",tea
My mother in law received this tea in as a gift for Christmas and I had a cup and it was delicious.  It was in sealed packets.  This tea is in paper packets like Lipton tea and does not taste any thing like my mother in laws.  Don't be disappointed like I am and save your money and do not buy this product.  Unfortunately I had to open the package to see and taste this so I could not return it.  I would give it no stars but I had to give it one to post.,tea
I just like the taste and the fact that it's green tea I haven't lost any weight but I love it just the same.  Sweet mild taste unlike regular green tea.,tea
"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.",tea
"I grew up with Lipton tea, so maybe at 67 I'm addicted. I love the taste and how it does not get bitter if I leave the teabag in too long.",tea
This is a great-tasting tea! The taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak. I will be purchasing more.,tea
"Newtons Fruit Thins are quite delicious.  As soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies, you can taste the real blueberries, right down to a few seeds, but I did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor. They are just the right thickness to be crispy, not hard.  The package contains a plastic tray with 2 rows of cookies, 15 cookies in each row. Very enjoyable!",flavor
I bought this to make a sauce and it taste great gives a good flavor.  I really enjoyed it an it lasts a long time.,flavor
These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.,flavor
"Generally speaking, I really like mini wheats, so this cereal was appealing to me already.  I enjoyed the flavor very much since it didn't taste artificial.  I also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup.  It gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat.  My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.  It is hard to measure 47 pieces (serving size) so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for.  Overall, the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy.  I'm looking forward to buying some more.",flavor
"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.  With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.",flavor
"This has a great flavor.  If you are concerned about what you give your kids and don't like all the extras that are put into kids foods, you'll love this. I have been looking for these for a while. My kids love the flavor of these in their lunchbox, and I do too! They taste fine with no extra junk in them.",flavor
Nice flavor-not overly ginger-hot. Quick ship for a lower price than I have seen from others. I will order again,flavor
"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.  This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version.",flavor
"Tastes like good, odorless, fresh, clean water. I like the fact the water is electrolyte infused.  The bottle is a very generous size, but easy to grip and hold.",baby_meal
"I need a filler and this was on sale at the moment for $6.5 for 6 it's worth it. Add water, chicken, potatoes, carrots, and mumble jumpbo. Result is good and tastety.  Individual package serve about 2 meals and it can not be save for long after opening, so plan carefully.",baby_meal
"My baby LOVES this stuff! I don't like peas, but I tried this once and it was not bad. I add cereal to make it thicker (my baby likes a paste-like consistency, always has), otherwise it is more like a medium-thick puree in consistency. I would absolutely recommend this product.",baby_meal
"I love the sauce with steak.  I haven't tried using it with anything suggested on the bottle yet.  With a nice Filet, though, delicious!!!",baby_meal
"I was told by the salesman at Guitar Center that the Icicle was easy and very high quality. . .  It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . .",baby_meal
"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!  How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!",baby_meal
"We love this product!  Our baby is 6 months old and we're introducing new foods to her.  So far she has tried the pumpkin, and she can't get enough!!!  She grabs for the spoon!  We love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients.  It's portable, compact, and you can take it anywhere.  If at a restaurant or away from home, simply warm up your milk and combine.  It's really fantastic!",baby_meal
"I can't believe I didn't check out the ingredients for this.  I never would have bought it if I would have known there was artificial sweetener in it!  First cup though, I got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote.  If you don't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems, you may like it.  Not worth it to us.",baby_meal
I know others like salt more than I do but I am not on a salt free diet or anything like that.  I love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste.,healthy food
"These little taffy's are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn't let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldn't eat the taffy some days and would be fine. All it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start.  This information may be useful since its not on amazon. Sugar free does not = carb free. A 1 pound bag is 453g.

"After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.  For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind: 1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining. 2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms. 3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis. In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it! Don't eat Nana's products!  Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.",healthy food

"I am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar. I've always enjoyed Haribo gummies, so I tried their sugar free version and WOW. You can't tell the difference. They are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same. As a matter of fact, so good, me kids ate almost all them. Not many candies I enjoy that are sugar free, but these are the ticket.",healthy food
"So many ""healthy"" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.",healthy food
"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.  I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.  I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing.",healthy food
"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts.  However, the unit description is incorrect.  It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars.",healthy food
I mix it with apple juice and throw a cup of honey nut cheerios into a blender with it and it taste fantastic. Love the product and planning on buying the 3 pound bag every time I run out!,chips
"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side. One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.  We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.  Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.  We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock. These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.",chips
I had these when in the Phillippines and then when I came had to have some more.  Even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks.,chips
"I went this way and that way for almost a month before ordering, and when I finally did order these chips, I wish I had ordered more!  I made the mistake of sharing with friends!  We all love this product and it is perfect for anything from snacking and dipping to use in casseroles.  Excellent flavor and taste; love them!  Nutritional value is not that bad compared to alternatives... but chips are chips, and these are worth it!",chips
"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.",chips
I bought these for a bridal shower for gift bags.  I received the item quickly and the chocolate was perfectly wrapped.  Another review noted that some of the wrappers were broken.  I only had maybe 1 where I had to fix the wrapper.  I thought they looked great.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I do feel as though it's overpriced for what you get.,chips
These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!,chips
"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can.",chips
"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice.",dog
We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,dog
"Well, I am neither British, nor British-born, but I absolutely love Marmite.  It is an acquired taste and one that produces very strong reactions indeed!  Their ""Love It Or Hate It"" ad says it all in fact.  As a proof of this, I have two dogs: one loves marmite sandwiches, the other one starts sneezing when she feels the smell of it.  My recipe for the perfect breakfast: marmite soldiers and soft boiled egg. Delicious!",dog
"My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again. There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China.",dog
"I compared so many different dog food brands before I settled on Blue Buffalo.  I used to feed my swiss mountain dogs Holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal (presumably to save $$).  Blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with Amazon prime.  Call me a nut but I always taste the food I feed my dogs so I can get a real idea of what I am feeding them, because lets be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them.  Lets just say that Blue Buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than Holistic or Eagle Pack did.  I also add a little pro-biotic to their food to help with digestion.  I will be buying Blue Buffalo in the future for my boys.",dog
"Used to subscribe to this item, as my dogs loved them, but I just found that they are made in china. I will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company.",dog
"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.  I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.  Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!  Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)  Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.",dog
"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.  The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.  Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.",dog
"My husband and I love to cook.  Jarred sun-dried tomatoes available in our area grocery stores have been a disappointment.  Not these! Flavorful and easy to use in a variety of dishes.  The flavor is a burst of summer sweetness. Often, these are eaten as ""chef's treats"" during cooking.  Price is more than fair.  I will keep  these on hand always.",grocery
I am trying to get away from drinking diet soda so I decided to try sparking water with lemon.  I love the taste of this brand and Amazon has a great price.,grocery

"My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.",grocery
"I'm glad I bought these before the price rose from $14.78 to $24.82.  They're good, but not worthy of such a large price hike. If the cost returns to a reasonable value I'll consider buying them again.",grocery
"My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854). to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations.",grocery

These rum cakes taste really great!  I get them for myself and also get them as gifts.  Last year I bought one for everyone on my team at work. They absolutety loved them and talked about how soft and moist they are?  I am glad I know where to find them as I buy them all the time.,grocery
These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I can't believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans!,snacks
"This Honey Granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to Cane Sugar. I use it in my morning oats (steel cut oats), Bird's custard and Tea. One or two teaspoonfuls go a long way. It is better stored in the refrigerator. Consider it in place of over-processed store bought cane sugar.",snacks
This product is absolutely delightful. They are better than chocolate to me and one taste and you are hooked!,snacks
"I tried the banana nut bread soft baked cereal bar and it was so good! If you like banana flavored anything, you will love this. This is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth, it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel. The best part is that is contains protein, B vitamins and fiber. I can't wait to try the cinnamon pecan!",snacks

"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}  I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.  This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review.",snacks
"these little cookies taste fantastic! not too sweet, just right....chocolate melts easily, so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only",snacks

"I wanted to try Cherrytree Cola for no particular reason other than I'd heard Fentimans makes some pretty good drinks. So I ordered a few from Amazon, and they shipped in like three days. I absolutely love this soda. I don't drink much pop because the carbonation is overbearing for me, but this was different. It was much smoother than regular colas and had a great taste. The only downside is that it's expensive. I won't be purchasing more right away, but if I could I would!",drinks
"Really good. I like it and I would drink this before or after a workout or run. My son who runs also thought it was really good. My other son did not like it too much. I can taste the pomegranate. The son that liked it gave it double thumbs up. I think it's light enough for an every day drink before working out. It has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you. Not so sure about that, but I am sure it tastes good.",drinks
"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing. I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices. Enjoy!",drinks
"This juice tastes great, and even my picky two year old loves it. It is very sweet so its perfect for those moms like myself who like to limit sugar (even natural kind) intake and delute down juices with water.",drinks
"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.",drinks
Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.,drinks
"This is a great meal replacement. I even throw in to the blender 1/2 fluids that are apple juice and water, 1/2 banana and a strawberry. Yummy and filling. I do not run out of steam on the tennis courts anymore.",drinks
"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!  Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.",drinks
"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!  First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!  Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!",carbohydrates_meal
"The molasses dominates the mix, and the chipotle doesn't assert itself as much as I would have liked, but all in all it is a passable barbecue sauce.  It goes especially well mixed into a pot of baked beans.",carbohydrates_meal
Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.,carbohydrates_meal
"I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (""Movie Size"" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again.",carbohydrates_meal
"I love Taco Bell so I knew I would love this sauce.  I have used it on chicken, veggies, baked potatoes and most recently, I put it on my mashed potatoes.  You can use this in many ways, salads, meats etc. The taste is creamy, rich and spicy but not too spicy.  it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos, then you will like this.  I am not a big fan of alot of spices and when I cook, I really cook plain but I do like this product.  It's not too much and not too little.  If you want to add a little zest to your every day meals, this is a good way to go. *************************************  THIS IS AN UPDATE, 2 WEEKS LATER Ok, for me, this sauce is not too spicy, however, I served it 2 times to company.  One time I used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time, I used it for a topping on taco night in my house.  Both times, my friends and family said it was too spicy for them.  I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.  So, if you like spice but not heat, this is a great sauce. There are many, many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish.  However, it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it..but it tastes great.",carbohydrates_meal
"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.  I do not recommend this product.",carbohydrates_meal
"This soup mix is so easy and tastes great! That being said, I add, 1 can of chicken breast, 1 can of white kidney beans, 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of frozen corn. I also add another 2 cups of water so it yields much more than 6 servings and is VERY hearty!  Overall, still a great price!",carbohydrates_meal
"I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, they're 5-star!).  This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!  I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!  I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!",carbohydrates_meal
When Habanero is in powder form it doesn't taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It's almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat.,chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"I love the bitter taste of chocolate, so I did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa. I did however find one negative review saying that theobromide, the primary stimulant in cocoa, is unhealthy and has similar side-effects as caffeine. I got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself. While I did have a small crash afterwards (after 3 tablespoons), the surge in energy that I felt was definitely worth it. It was not the jittery surge I was warned about, and the crash actually helps me sleep if I time it right. Not to mention the taste is so good (and yet mild) that I could eat it by the spoonful on its own. Thinking that was the end of it, I also ordered cocoa nibs. Terrible mistake. I don't know exactly why, but I got the exact side-effects I was warned about, not to mention the energy was lower in quality. This is definitely the better alternative.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
My cats love this food and particularly the duck flavor.  This is a high quality cat food however depending on your cat he/she may prefer another brand/flavor.  What can be said is that this is a really healthy food for your cat.,cat
"Great food for my cat.  He always looks healthy, sleek, and shiny.  Has been his diet for 3 years.  The last time I ordered this food from Amazon it was around $11.  Why the big price increase?  Will look local now.",cat
My kitties eat Wellness grainfree canned food and I wanted to try the pouches after others told me their cats loved them.  So do mine!  They eat the chunks first and then lick the gravy.  So now I feed them both the canned and pouches.  I love Wellness food for my cats.,cat
My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...,cat
"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.  TRY THIS INSTEAD:  Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag",cat

My dog gets Canidae (same brand as Felidae) All Life Stages dry kibble which I also recommend.",cat
