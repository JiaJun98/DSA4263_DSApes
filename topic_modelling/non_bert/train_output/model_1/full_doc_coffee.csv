5,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.  I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.   When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.","['store', 'seller', 'problem', 'expiration', 'date', 'coffee', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'kind', 'brew', 'coffee', 'chemical', 'coffee', 'consumer', 'folgers', 'flavor', 'brand', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'sip', 'sort', 'chemical', 'flavor', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'time', 'cup', 'coffee', 'cup', 'equivalent']",1
8,"I wish Gevalia came with an option for whole beans, but as pre-ground coffee goes, this makes a great Sunday morning treat.

30,Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.  I do like my coffee a little on the strong side and can use the pod to make a very big cup of coffee before tossing.

35,"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!","['cup', 'k-cups', 'cup', 'instruction', 'filter', 'coffee', 'lid', 'trouble', 'filter', 'size', 'shape', 'edge', 'cup', 'cup', 'filter', 'lid', 'coffee', 'k-cup', 'cup', 'keurig', 'machine', 'vinegar', 'result', 'effort']",1

52,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.","['january', 'drinker', 'stuff', 'fact', 'price', 'shipping', 'steal', 'coffee', 'folgers', 'home', 'year', 'surprise', 'aroma', 'creamer', 'sugar', 'treat', 'bud', 'cup', 'coffee', 'full', 'make', 'cup', 'coffee', 'maker', 'line', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'package', 'way', 'scissors', 'metal', 'package', 'coffee', 'way']",1

103,"I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.  Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.  This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.  They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.

133,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.  When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).  For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.","['coffee', 'drinker', 'judgement', 'stomach', 'condition', 'decaf', 'year', 'coffee', 'office', 'lot', 'money', 'penny', 'melitta', 'cafe', 'ground', 'coffee', 'cup', 'aroma', 'cream', 'splendas', 'coffee', 'cup', 'couple', 'day', 'coffee', 'coffee', 'wine', 'variety', 'level', 'bitterness', 'coffee', 'one', 'coffee', 'mcdonald', 'cup', 'pack', 'price', 'try']",1

I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.

I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.  Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.  Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!","['yes', 'energy', 'starbucks', 'shot', 'caffeine', 'overload', 'energy', 'drink', 'dosage', 'caffeine', 'caffeine', 'content', 'guayaki', 'shot', 'energy', 'drink', 'people', 'brand', 'caffeine', 'sugar', 'guayaki', 'buy', 'energy', 'boost', 'guayaki', 'shot', 'effect', 'irritability', 'mood-swings', 'caffeine', 'overdose', 'coffee', 'energy', 'drink', 'buy', 'sugar', 'bunch', 'chemical', 'shot', 'starbucks', 'drink', 'energy', 'boost', 'last', 'hour', 'minute', 'note', 'protein', 'drink', 'thing', 'morning', 'fattening', 'food', 'sleepy']",1

1600,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).  Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.  There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.  1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.  2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.  Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.

To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.  The flavor is excellent, and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.

Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.

3251,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.","['peaberry', 'year', 'source', 'retailer', 'wholesaler', 'green', 'mountain', 'peaberry', 'light', 'bean', 'coffee', 'mountain', 'price', 'seach', 'roaster', 'bean', 'appearance', 'level', 'liking', 'bean', 'caffeine', 'flavor', 'coffee', 'darker', 'roast', 'tennessee', 'roaster', 'computer', 'sale', 'internet', 'search', 'peaberry', 'coffee', 'bean', 'peaberry', 'tennessee', 'roaster', 'price', 'bean', 'coffee', 'bean', 'shipping', 'pound', 'time']",1

3260,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends. Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory. A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines. A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste.

I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag. I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition.

I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.  When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.

I am not sure how good a value it will as I do not have access to that info at this point.","['gevalia', 'coffee', 'full-strength', 'coffee', 'maybe', 'way', 'coffee', 'kind', 'brewer', 'basket', 'cone', 'gevalia-brand', 'brewer', 'fan', 'coffee', 'brand', 'additive', 'dark-chocolate', 'flavor', 'value', 'access', 'info', 'point']",1
3845,This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.,"['coffee', 'kcups', 'kind', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'buttery', 'cheese', 'jean', 'timothy', 'coffee', 'puck', 'kcup', 'brand', 'cup', 'box', 'box', 'nastiness']",1
3864,"I really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup. I can brew one cup and get a full size cup, unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee. In the mornings, I want a full cup of coffee to go. I don't want to full around with a small sample. Besides that, the taste suits me. We have tried lots of the others, but I have since settled on this one for my taste. Try it!

I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend.

4076,"Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter- I like bitter but I didn't like this. It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a ""cringe"" kind of taste.  I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off... I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.  Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.  It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.  No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.  You can go down to the local ""name of popular coffee shop here"" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.  Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..  If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special.","['reviewer', 'coffee', 'bitter', 'bitter', 'cringe', 'kind', 'coffee', 'coffee', 'pot', 'melitta', 'cone', 'filter', 'coffee', 'yes', 'charlie', 'reviewer', 'package', 'bag', 'way', 'buck', 'future', 'coffee', 'shop', 'bag', 'price', 'ground', 'coffee', 'melitta', 'thing', 'bread', 'package', 'water', 'process', 'europe', 'sidewalk', 'hand-', 'bean', 'kind', 'money', 'melitta', 'coffee']",1

Used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness (and actually once it was in coffee, to me it was the same flavor as sugar - with no aftertaste). I don't like splenda very much and can't stand sweet n low. Been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt. Excited!

The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected?  There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.  The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.
