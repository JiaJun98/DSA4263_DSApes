5,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.  I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.   When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.","['store', 'seller', 'problem', 'expiration', 'date', 'coffee', 'picky', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'kind', 'stronger', 'brew', 'flavored', 'coffee', 'suppose', 'chemical', 'coffee', 'consumer', 'folgers', 'different', 'flavor', 'theirs', 'k-cup', 'brand', 'disappointed', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'sip', 'sort', 'chemical', 'strong', 'flavor', 'coffee', 'caramel', 'time', 'unable', 'cup', 'coffee', 'entire', 'cup', 'equivalent']",1

30,Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.

35,"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!","['anxious', 'cup', 'original', 'k-cups', 'disappointed', 'cup', 'instruction', 'apparent', 'filter', 'add', 'coffee', 'lid', 'trouble', 'filter', 'size', 'shape', 'outside', 'edge', 'cup', 'impossible', 'cup', 'filter', 'able', 'lid', 'coffee', 'slow', 'k-cup', 'cup', 'keurig', 'machine', 'vinegar', 'result', 'effort']",1

52,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011 I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.","['update', 'january', 'regular', 'drinker', 'stuff', 'fact', 'price', 'afforable', 'free', 'shipping', 'delicious', 'steal', 'coffee', 'folgers', 'home', 'year', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'aroma', 'regular', 'creamer', 'sugar', 'treat', 'bud', 'cup', 'smooth', 'coffee', 'tea-spoon', 'full', 'make', 'cup', 'coffee', 'maker', 'right', 'hard', 'line', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'stronger', 'package', 'little', 'hard', 'best', 'way', 'scissors', 'metal', 'package', 'possible', 'coffee', 'way', 'sure']",1

103,"I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.  Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.  This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.  They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.

133,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.  When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).  For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.","['big', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'better', 'judgement', 'stomach', 'condition', 'decaf', 'year', 'cheapest', 'coffee', 'near', 'office', 'lot', 'money', 'penny', 'melitta', 'cafe', 'ground', 'coffee', 'cup', 'pleasant', 'aroma', 'little', 'cream', 'splendas', 'little', 'light', 'bitter', 'decaf', 'pureness', '50-cent', 'coffee', 'cup', 'couple', 'day', 'coffee', 'coffee', 'wine', 'different', 'variety', 'level', 'bitterness', 'gourmet', 'coffee', 'one', 'local', 'coffee', 'mcdonald', 'free', 'cup', 'pack', 'price', 'decent', 'decaf', 'worth', 'try']",1

When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar.

1600,"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).  Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.  There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.  1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.  2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.  Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.

I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's.

Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.

Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.

3251,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.

That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines. A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks.

That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.  When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.

There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.  The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company.

I only received one can as part of the Vine program, but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will, without doubt, purchase further cans of it.","['fan', 'coffee', 'general', 'bean', 'ground', 'likely', 'cappucino', 'coffee', 'flavor', 'drink', 'heavy', 'coffee', 'light', 'milk', 'lowfat', 'bitterness', 'coffee', 'milk', 'drink', 'coffee', 'flavor', 'milky', 'coffee', 'flavor', 'hint', 'sweetness', 'sweetness', 'closer', 'calorie', 'decent', 'caffeine', 'denmark', 'coca', 'cola', 'company', 'weird', 'italian', 'brand', 'guess', 'italy', 'idea', 'vine', 'program', 'single', 'serve', 'can', 'purchase', 'can']",1

4351,I love my Tassimo Coffee machine and I love the Gevalia Signature Blend Coffee.  It is great any time of day.  Never bitter or over bearing.. always smooth and mild.  I have been using it for over 2 years now and the coffee is brewed the same for every cup.  I highly recommend Tassimo machine and Gevalia Signature blend coffee.,"['tassimo', 'coffee', 'machine', 'gevalia', 'signature', 'coffee', 'time', 'bearing', 'year', 'coffee', 'cup', 'recommend', 'tassimo', 'machine', 'gevalia', 'signature', 'coffee']",1
