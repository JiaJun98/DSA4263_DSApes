12,"My vet recommended these for my half-Siamese, very particular, cat because she kept having tarter buildup (and, as a result, bad breath). I was skeptical because my cat is VERY picky about food. She LOVES them. It is her ""treat"" each day. Well, my vet stopped carrying them, so I came to Amazon and now I never have to worry about quick delivery, tarter buildup, bad breath or an unhappy kitty! Life is great with CET Enzematic cat chews!","['vet', 'half-siamese', 'particular', 'cat', 'tarter', 'buildup', 'result', 'bad', 'breath', 'skeptical', 'cat', 'picky', 'food', 'treat', 'vet', 'quick', 'delivery', 'tarter', 'buildup', 'bad', 'breath', 'unhappy', 'kitty', 'life', 'cet', 'enzematic', 'cat', 'chew']",0
42,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.  The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!  I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!","['cat', 'year', 'cat', 'adult', 'lamb', 'rice', 'dry', 'cat', 'food', 'bag', 'savory', 'aroma', 'cat', 'turkish', 'angora', 'marking', 'similar', 'snow', 'leopard', 'cat', 'egyptian', 'mau', 'feral', 'cat', 'yard', 'year', 'food', 'formula', 'food', 'year', 'ingredient', 'real', 'plus', 'diet', 'year', 'cat', 'nose', 'food', 'dry', 'food', 'cat', 'fancy', 'gourmet', 'filet', 'mignon', 'flavor', 'real', 'seafood', 'shrimp', 'dry', 'cat', 'food', 'eagle', 'pack', 'natural', 'pet', 'food', 'indoor', 'formula', 'cat', 'cat', 'food', 'brand', 'problem', 'dry', 'food', 'cat', 'year', 'cat', 'time', 'set', 'kitten', 'outdoor', 'indoors', 'mother', 'year', 'age', 'eukanuba', 'lamb', 'rice', 'food', 'nose', 'like', 'soup', 'wild', 'way', 'human', 'like', 'dislike', 'way', 'cat', 'like', 'dislike', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'love', 'eukanuba', 'lamb', 'rice', 'cat', 'fair', 'food', 'review', 'owner', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'food', 'review', 'food', 'hit', 'cat']",0

193,"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.

383,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.  Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.  The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't.

I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue.

771,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.  I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.  My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.  I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.  For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.  We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.  A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.  So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.  I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.  Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","['review', 'stupid', 'people', 'real', 'mistake', 'wonderful', 'little', 'sweet', 'bella', 'bean', 'day', 'shy', 'year', 'old', 'house', 'house', 'cheap', 'entire', 'life', 'twenty-five', 'year', 'mother', 'kind', 'food', 'supermarket', 'friskies', 'life', 'kaboodle', 'stuff', 'cat', 'fine', 'term', 'habit', 'morning', 'stop', 'hungry', 'housemate', 'time', 'hill', 'best', 'food', 'forth', 'utter', 'buffoon', 'judgment', 'unfortunate', 'plenty', 'coupon', 'free', 'bag', 'attractive', 'choice', 'little', 'bean', 'unmeasured', 'science', 'diet', 'bowl', 'work', 'thing', 'crazy', 'middle', 'thing', 'water', 'cry', 'food', 'serving', 'thing', 'serving', 'little', 'better', 'maintenance', 'unrealistic', 'time', 'food', 'cup', 'little', 'chubby', 'reducing', 'hell', 'hungry', 'morning', 'food', 'way', 'thing', 'desk', 'paper', 'door', 'general', 'act', 'mischief', 'food', 'sweet', 'self', 'hour', 'little', 'nutty', 'kitty', 'eating', 'disorder', 'food', 'kind', 'funny', 'end', 'sad', 'week', 'new', 'non-money', 'factory', 'vet', 'second', 'checkup', 'adult', 'indoor', 'science', 'diet', 'food', 'garbage', 'cat', 'food', 'protein', 'carbohydrate', 'ingredient', 'science', 'diet', 'loose', 'by-product', 'kind', 'way', 'ground', 'slaughterhouse', 'leftover', 'corn', 'dust', 'bunch', 'vitamin', 'healthy', 'ingredient', 'money', 'bean', 'food', 'way', 'expensive', 'wellness', 'indoor', 'formula', 'week', 'percent', 'science', 'diet', 'percent', 'wellness', 'cat', 'different', 'food', 'blue', 'percent', 'real', 'food', 'sawdust', 'chicken', 'heart', 'regrettable', 'cup', 'total', 'time', 'cup', 'total', 'morning', 'hour', 'dinner', 'hour', 'initial', 'feeding', 'knocking', 'thing', 'trashing', 'dad', 'paper', 'desk', 'howling', 'spilled', 'water', 'floor', 'incredible', 'feel', 'bad', 'long', 'dramatic', 'hungry', 'real', 'food', 'favor', 'food', 'real', 'ingredient', 'thing', 'wellness', 'halo', 'innova', 'figure', 'cat', 'garbage']",0

Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.","['cat', 'elderly', 'cat', 'year', 'range', 'oldest', 'cat', 'couple', 'month', 'stage', 'chronic', 'kidney', 'number', 'prescription', 'food', 'attention', 'thing', 'protein', 'phosphorus', 'level', 'food', 'cat', 'nibbler', 'nugget', 'time', 'acceptable', 'food', 'oldest', 'active', 'longevity', 'kidney', 'support', 'calorie', 'active', 'older', 'cat', 'switch', 'week', 'cat', 'weight', 'fine', 'little', 'old', 'guy', 'bit', 'underweight', 'rest', 'male', 'chunky', 'lb', 'obese', 'lb', 'pound', 'week', 'female', 'pound', 'lot', 'visit', 'food', 'bowl', 'lessening', 'coat', 'lot', 'furminator', 'bad', 'stool', 'bad', 'diarrhea', 'grateful', 'worrisome', 'lab', 'result', 'old', 'guy', 'kidney', 'value', 'concern', 'disgusted', 'science', 'diet', 'public', 'nutritional', 'claim', 'bag', 'site', 'chronic', 'renal', 'failure', 'chart', 'nutritional', 'breakdown', 'various', 'food', 'available', 'various', 'science', 'diet', 'formula', 'different', 'health', 'claim', 'nutritional', 'value', 'component', 'tenth', 'point', 'nutritional', 'analysis', 'base', 'formula', 'slight', 'difference', 'vitamin', 'additive', 'brand', 'innova', 'royal', 'canin', 'actual', 'difference', 'different', 'formula', 'weight', 'gain', 'problem', 'food', 'time', 'royal', 'canin', 'indoor', 'mature', 'wish']",0

1576,"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":  Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food   Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts   My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.  I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.  I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!  But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.

2318,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""  So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.  We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)  It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).

I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):  Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.  If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.  My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her. What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her.

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.
