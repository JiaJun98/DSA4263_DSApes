Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.

527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor.

I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.

It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.

My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?

2148,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).

I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.

I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me.

Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!  Not a good buy IMO.

Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.  The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.  And the chocolate square is nummy. :D  The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.

3508,"When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's.  Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste. Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered.

The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.  If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).  Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.

3910,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.","['gf', 'thing', 'drop', 'box', 'kind', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'result', 'gf', 'bisquick', 'tart', 'buttermilk', 'milk', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'problem', 'mix', 'box', 'cup', 'mix', 'box', 'serving', 'cup', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'cup', 'mix', 'teaspoonful', 'cup', 'cup', 'mix', 'bag', 'mix', 'wheat', 'flour', 'kind', 'measure', 'bag', 'cup', 'recipe', 'misprint', 'box', 'biscuit', 'gravy', 'butter', 'jam', 'mcdonald', 'breakfast', 'sandwich', 'instruction', 'lot', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'half', 'plenty', 'box', 'mix', 'cost', 'box', 'biscuit', 'budget', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'egg', 'crumbly', 'one', 'egg', 'color', 'biscuit', 'shortening', 'cutter', 'fork', 'celiac', 'biscuit', 'cutter', 'box', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'milk', 'tart', 'bisquick', 'mix', 'rice', 'flour', 'sugar', 'potato', 'starch', 'salt', 'xanthum', 'mix', 'goody', 'rice', 'flour', 'grainy', 'bisquick', 'job', 'rice', 'flour', 'repeat', 'starch', 'corn', 'potato', 'tapioca', 'lightness', 'item', 'rice', 'leavening', 'soda', 'powder', 'sugar', 'salt', 'flavor', 'consistency', 'yes', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'ingredient', 'good', 'bit', 'elasticity', 'replacement', 'gluten', 'gum', 'baked', 'goodie', 'people', 'disease', 'mix', 'money', 'sure', 'time', 'ground', 'rice', 'flour', 'predominant', 'ingredient', 'mix', 'recipe', 'box', 'pancake', 'waffle', 'shortcake', 'chicken', 'finger', 'chicken', 'recipe', 'website', 'mix', 'box', 'price']",7

I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.

I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).  My secret pate recipe:  5 ounces rendered duck fat 1 lb chicken livers 1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons) 1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press 1 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 1 tbs cognac or dry sherry One loaf of 2""x2"" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter) Olive oil Garlic salt Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator. Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.","['duck', 'fat', 'company', 'chicken', 'liver', 'pate', 'palletes', 'pate', 'duck', 'fat', 'pound', 'liver', 'tollerance', 'pate', 'recipe', 'ounce', 'lb', 'chicken', 'liver', 'shallot', 'tablespoon', 'provence', 'marjoram', 'thyme', 'work', 'press', 'tsp', 'sea', 'salt', 'pepper', 'tb', 'cognac', 'sherry', 'loaf', 'rye', 'pumpernickel', 'look', 'counter', 'oil', 'garlic', 'salt', 'pate', 'ingredient', 'liver', 'mixture', 'food', 'processor', 'add', 'mixture', 'food', 'processer', 'seasoning', 'cool', 'refrigerator', 'bread', 'heat', 'slice', 'oil', 'place', 'layer', 'sheet', 'pan', 'salt', 'cook', 'minute', 'crouton-like', 'doneness']",7
