60,"I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend.","['oreo', 'new', 'fudge', 'one', 'favorite', 'mint', 'peanut', 'butter', 'version', 'peanut', 'butter', 'mint', 'favorite', 'bad', 'kid', 'old', 'boy', 'old', 'girl', 'cooky', 'mind', 'sign', 'kid', 'disappointment', 'cookie', 'half', 'cost', 'similar', 'oreo', 'time', 'cookie', 'way', 'cookie']",9
72,"I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.

92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.","['lot', 'cereal', 'lot', 'high-fiber', 'kind', 'oatmeal', 'mini', 'shredded', 'wheat', 'raisin', 'bran', 'instance', 'healthier', 'option', 'tried', 'kashi', 'cereal', 'plain', 'cardboard', 'grape', 'nut', 'horrendous', 'yeast', 'cat', 'food', 'closer', 'litter', 'texture', 'antioxidant', 'berry', 'yogurt', 'crunch', 'better', 'high-fiber', 'cereal', 'decent', 'health', 'bar', 'broken', 'cereal', 'cluster', 'yogurt', 'plain', 'cereal', 'decent', 'yes', 'sugar', 'fiber', 'calorie', 'part', 'bran', 'wheat', 'higher', 'sugar', 'calorie', 'lower', 'dietary', 'antioxidant', 'bonus', 'line', 'grocery', 'list', 'sale', 'price', 'right']",9

122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.

129,"As far as cookies go, this isn't going to ruin your diet (much) and it's pretty tasty too!  Three cookies, and they aren't tiny cookies either, are 140 calories.  There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called ""cookies"" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!

152,"There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}  I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.  This is a great product.

It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.

811,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)  Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!","['low', 'carb', 'diet', 'natural', 'sugar', 'honey', 'blood', 'sugar', 'insulin', 'hormone', 'message', 'fat', 'insulin', 'kidney', 'water', 'high', 'carb', 'diet', 'dilemma', 'sweet', 'problem', 'thanks', 'product', 'stevia', 'natural', 'plant', 'part', 'world', 'sweetener', 'hundred', 'year', 'calorie', 'impact', 'blood', 'sugar', 'people', 'bit', 'brain', 'sugar', 'stevia', 'legal', 'usa', 'cosmetic', 'politics', 'company', 'low', 'calorie', 'sweetener', 'aspartame', 'competition', 'aspartame', 'headache', 'symptom', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'stevia', 'time', 'aftertaste', 'bad', 'honest', 'crazy', 'tried', 'nunaturals', 'awesome', 'stevia', 'delicious', 'aftertaste', 'way', 'common', 'mistake', 'people', 'new', 'tablet', 'powdered', 'form', 'bottle', 'handy', 'packet', 'individual', 'serving', 'alcohol-free', 'liquid', 'form', 'vanilla', 'flavor', 'aspartame', 'toxic', 'stevia', 'nunaturals', 'stevia', 'blend', 'raw', 'fooder', 'sure', 'judging', 'product', 'thanks', 'product', 'low', 'carb', 'raw', 'diet', 'sweet']",9

927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.","['sort', 'thing', 'rare', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'brand', 'doubt', 'main', 'competitor', 'better', 'mixed', 'almost-cheese', 'sauce', 'milk', 'toss-up', 'term', 'nutrition', 'nutritional', 'champ', 'prepared', 'calorie', 'calorie', 'mg', 'sodium', 'kraft', 'velveeta', 'cheesy', 'skillet', 'overall', 'protein', 'g', 'g', 'dietary', 'fiber', 'g', 'gram', 'competitor', 'difference', 'attributable', 'cheese', 'sauce', 'edge', 'total', 'fat', 'g', 'ground', 'beef', 'difference', 'daily', 'fat', 'significant', 'brand', 'transfat', 'list', 'oil', 'ingredient', 'half-gram', 'disclosure', 'package', 'cup', 'dinner', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'g', 'transfat', 'saturated', 'fat', 'ground', 'beef', 'gram', 'sodium', 'meal', 'daily', 'value', 'sodium', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'definition', 'sound', 'choice', 'case', 'thing', 'price', 'availability', 'equal']",9

950,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago.  I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).

The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.  A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.  All in all, this is still a decent option for days when you know you're going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would-be fridge thieves.","['healthy', 'choice', 'fresh', 'mixer', 'option', 'quick', 'microwave', 'meal', 'compact', 'nonperishable', 'packaging', 'thing', 'perfect', 'office', 'purse', 'office', 'cadger', 'pasta', 'sauce', 'rotini', 'zesty', 'marinara', 'sauce', 'garlicy', 'portion', 'size', 'entree', 'small', 'entire', 'meal', 'desk', 'chance', 'time', 'meal', 'plastic', 'handle', 'bowl', 'stay', 'easy', 'desk', 'tepid', 'spot', 'flaming', 'hot', 'piece', 'microwaved', 'cardboard', 'hall', 'finger', 'couple', 'thing', 'rating', 'star', 'sodium', 'comfortable', 'health', 'conscious', 'bit', 'plastic', 'packaging', 'meal', 'small', 'package', 'purse', 'briefcase', 'layer', 'landfill', 'oceanic', 'garbage', 'patch', 'decent', 'option', 'day', 'busy', 'deli', 'sack', 'lunch', 'bean', 'curd', 'would-be', 'fridge', 'thief']",9

The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.  On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.  When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.  I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet.

Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.  (4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.

I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.  As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.  I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.  I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had.

2080,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars.

Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening.

They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack.

I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!  I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! My only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn't forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor. Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how ""fresh"" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)","['erin', 'baker', 'breakfast', 'cookie', 'caramel', 'apple', 'flavor', 'fulfilling', 'forsure', 'love', 'time', 'customer', 'review', 'morning', 'glory', 'breakfast', 'cookie', 'bit', 'nut', 'favorite', 'cookie', 'star', 'rating', 'cookie', 'flavor', 'spent', 'time', 'customer', 'review', 'peanut', 'butter', 'chocolate', 'chunk', 'time', 'charm', 'breakfast', 'cooky', 'sock', 'delicious', 'plan', 'hot', 'summer', 'month', 'cookie', 'cooky', 'fresh', 'preservative', 'spoilage', 'prone', 'figure', 'chance', 'purchase', 'summer', 'breakfast', 'cooky', 'wish', 'variety', 'box', 'pack', 'flavor', 'little', 'high', 'calorie', 'snack', 'meal', 'replacement', 'fantastic', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'cooky', 'fresh', 'fresh', 'meal', 'replacement', 'bar', 'sit', 'store', 'shelf', 'month']",9

3599,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.  300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.  I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.  The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.  Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)  I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.  UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime.

It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.

4277,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.","['problem', 'peanut', 'butter', 'use', 'evaporated', 'cane', 'juice', 'coy', 'way', 'raw', 'sugar', 'accent', 'sugar', 'sugar', 'gritty', 'peanut', 'maple', 'maple-y', 'gritty', 'sweet', 'cane', 'juice', 'low', 'moisture', 'content', 'peanut', 'butter', 'loser', 'hype', 'peanut', 'butter', 'peanut', 'butter', 'sandwich', 'restaurant', 'new', 'york', 'pbj', 'celery', 'pb', 'tablespoon', 'peanut', 'butter', 'snack', 'food', 'intake', 'peanut', 'butter', 'sugary', 'taste', 'star', 'confection', 'cooky', 'eat-alone', 'peanut', 'butter', 'way', 'sweet', 'gritty', 'taste']",9
