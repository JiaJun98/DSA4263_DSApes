1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.","['citrus', 'drink', 'sweet', 'sour', 'bubble', 'sparkle', 'addition', 'punch', 'favorite', 'fruit', 'juice', 'draw', 'tad', 'bit', 'expencive', 'family', 'normal', 'beverage', 'choice', 'terrific', 'treat', 'occational', 'indulgence']",9

24,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.","['vine', 'se', 'carbonated', 'water', 'concentrate', 'mixture', 'apple', 'grape', 'tangerine', 'acai', 'concentrate', 'list', 'apple', 'grape', 'common', 'fruit', 'sweetener', 'beverage', 'taste', 'calorie', 'lot', 'oz', 'carbonated', 'water', 'carbohydrate', 'gram', 'carbs', 'gram', 'sugar', 'apple', 'grape', 'highest', 'concentration', 'fructose', 'fruit', 'sugar', 'commercial', 'beverage', 'sweeter', 'regular', 'cane', 'sugar', 'cheaper', 'diarrhea', 'child', 'drink', 'hit', 'parade', 'pretend', 'healthy', 'drinks-', 'mass', 'concern', 'ever-growing', 'girth', 'continued', 'growth', 'better', 'diet', 'coke', 'better', 'sparkling', 'water', 'calorie', 'favorite', 'bella', 'familglia', 'pomegranate', 'lime', 'lemon', 'orange', 'flavor', 'time', 'time', 'local', 'supermarket', 'organic', 'pure', 'fruit', 'juice', 'pomegranate', 'pour', 'cup', 'glass', 'favorite', 'sparking', 'water', 'quarter', 'cup', 'oz', 'bottle', 'favorite', 'sparkling', 'water', 'actual', 'juice', 'fructose', 'extract']",9
28,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.

The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener.

79,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.","['coconut', 'water', 'hint', 'pineapple', 'indonesia', 'non-recyclable', 'disposable', 'container', 'sport', 'market', 'source', 'electrolyte', 'ounce', 'container', 'poured', 'serving', 'teenager', 'adult', 'impression', 'teen', 'athlete', 'drink', 'mention', 'potential', 'sport', 'result', 'negative', 'vote', 'drink', 'pineapple', 'flavor', 'strange', 'feeling', 'mouth', 'teen', 'coconut', 'water', 'residual', 'flavor', 'straw', 'package', 'opening', 'pouring', 'assistance', 'fork', 'sugar', 'water', 'bother', 'biggest', 'issue', 'waste', 'coconut', 'sugar', 'water', 'indonesia', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'container', 'symbol', 'milk', 'carton', 'difficult', 'community', 'landfill', 'line', 'sugar', 'water', 'transport', 'packaging', 'waste', 'culture', 'sustainability']",9
92,"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.","['lot', 'cereal', 'lot', 'high-fiber', 'kind', 'oatmeal', 'mini', 'shredded', 'wheat', 'raisin', 'bran', 'instance', 'healthier', 'option', 'tried', 'kashi', 'cereal', 'plain', 'cardboard', 'grape', 'nut', 'horrendous', 'yeast', 'cat', 'food', 'closer', 'litter', 'texture', 'antioxidant', 'berry', 'yogurt', 'crunch', 'better', 'high-fiber', 'cereal', 'decent', 'health', 'bar', 'broken', 'cereal', 'cluster', 'yogurt', 'plain', 'cereal', 'decent', 'yes', 'sugar', 'fiber', 'calorie', 'part', 'bran', 'wheat', 'higher', 'sugar', 'calorie', 'lower', 'dietary', 'antioxidant', 'bonus', 'line', 'grocery', 'list', 'sale', 'price', 'right']",9

122,"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.

811,"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)  Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!","['low', 'carb', 'diet', 'natural', 'sugar', 'honey', 'blood', 'sugar', 'insulin', 'hormone', 'message', 'fat', 'insulin', 'kidney', 'water', 'high', 'carb', 'diet', 'dilemma', 'sweet', 'problem', 'thanks', 'product', 'stevia', 'natural', 'plant', 'part', 'world', 'sweetener', 'hundred', 'year', 'calorie', 'impact', 'blood', 'sugar', 'people', 'bit', 'brain', 'sugar', 'stevia', 'legal', 'usa', 'cosmetic', 'politics', 'company', 'low', 'calorie', 'sweetener', 'aspartame', 'competition', 'aspartame', 'headache', 'symptom', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'stevia', 'time', 'aftertaste', 'bad', 'honest', 'crazy', 'tried', 'nunaturals', 'awesome', 'stevia', 'delicious', 'aftertaste', 'way', 'common', 'mistake', 'people', 'new', 'tablet', 'powdered', 'form', 'bottle', 'handy', 'packet', 'individual', 'serving', 'alcohol-free', 'liquid', 'form', 'vanilla', 'flavor', 'aspartame', 'toxic', 'stevia', 'nunaturals', 'stevia', 'blend', 'raw', 'fooder', 'sure', 'judging', 'product', 'thanks', 'product', 'low', 'carb', 'raw', 'diet', 'sweet']",9

Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.  The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.

1158,"With  Green Mountain Hot Cocoa  being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.  Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.  Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.  As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or "" Splenda "" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.

I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.  When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.

What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.  (4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.

Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit!

It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.  Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.

2080,"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars.

3660,I received my box of Pure Natural Bars right before going on a long road trip. I took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while I traveled. I am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and I didn't feel like I was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients. The mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over-sweetened snack bars.  Pros: - Natural Ingredients - Pleasant Texture - Great Taste  Cons: - Wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky  Overall I recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients.,"['box', 'pure', 'natural', 'bar', 'right', 'long', 'road', 'trip', 'bar', 'hunger', 'pang', 'pleased', 'little', 'snack', 'bar', 'job', 'tummy', 'happy', 'preservative', 'artificial', 'ingredient', 'mixture', 'fruit', 'nut', 'sweet', 'nutty', 'flavor', 'experience', 'change', 'bland', 'over-sweetened', 'snack', 'bar', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'pleasant', 'texture', 'con', 'little', 'difficult', 'bar', 'sticky', 'overall', 'snack', 'bar', 'convenient', 'snack', 'guilty', 'artificial', 'ingredient']",9

It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.

This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.  The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.  What kills this product is the high price.

3946,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.  Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.

I can get the same results from a Hostess Fruit cake, and only spend $3.50, instead of close to 30 dollars for the Clayton cakes.","['christmas', 'clayton', 'fruit', 'big', 'cherry', 'fruit', 'nut', 'stuff', 'fruit', 'cake', 're-ordered', 'christmas', 'disappointment', 'pound', 'excited', 'fruit', 'cake', 'disappointed', 'cake', 'void', 'fruit', 'raisons', 'fruit', 'clayton', 'fruit', 'cake', 'result', 'hostess', 'fruit', 'cake', 'dollar', 'clayton', 'cake']",9

4098,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.  I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.","['anxious', 'sip', 'apparent', 'drink', 'citrus-y', 'metallic', 'flavor', 'overwhelming', 'sweetness', 'battle', 'mouth', 'dominance', 'drink', 'like', 'syrup', 'carbonated', 'beverage', 'small', 'regular', 'sized', 'pop', 'oz', 'cost', 'little', 'guy', 'little', 'bit', 'astronomical', 'bit', 'dubious', 'attempt', 'healthy', 'alternative', 'load', 'sugar', 'additional', 'sugar', 'sugar', 'low', 'sugar', 'fact', 'gram']",9

As I diabetic type II I often have hunger pangs throughout the day. Pieces from one bar provided my body with enough energy to make it dinner time without the need for a sugar lift.

4224,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).  My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.

4277,"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes.
