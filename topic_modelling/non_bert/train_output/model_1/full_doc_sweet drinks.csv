1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.","['citrus', 'drink', 'sweet', 'sour', 'bubble', 'sparkle', 'addition', 'punch', 'favorite', 'fruit', 'juice', 'draw', 'tad', 'bit', 'expencive', 'family', 'normal', 'beverage', 'choice', 'terrific', 'treat', 'occational', 'indulgence']",10
24,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.","['vine', 'se', 'carbonated', 'water', 'concentrate', 'mixture', 'apple', 'grape', 'tangerine', 'acai', 'concentrate', 'list', 'apple', 'grape', 'common', 'fruit', 'sweetener', 'beverage', 'taste', 'calorie', 'lot', 'oz', 'carbonated', 'water', 'carbohydrate', 'gram', 'carbs', 'gram', 'sugar', 'apple', 'grape', 'highest', 'concentration', 'fructose', 'fruit', 'sugar', 'commercial', 'beverage', 'sweeter', 'regular', 'cane', 'sugar', 'cheaper', 'diarrhea', 'child', 'drink', 'hit', 'parade', 'pretend', 'healthy', 'drinks-', 'mass', 'concern', 'ever-growing', 'girth', 'continued', 'growth', 'better', 'diet', 'coke', 'better', 'sparkling', 'water', 'calorie', 'favorite', 'bella', 'familglia', 'pomegranate', 'lime', 'lemon', 'orange', 'flavor', 'time', 'time', 'local', 'supermarket', 'organic', 'pure', 'fruit', 'juice', 'pomegranate', 'pour', 'cup', 'glass', 'favorite', 'sparking', 'water', 'quarter', 'cup', 'oz', 'bottle', 'favorite', 'sparkling', 'water', 'actual', 'juice', 'fructose', 'extract']",10
28,"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.

77,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

79,"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.","['coconut', 'water', 'hint', 'pineapple', 'indonesia', 'non-recyclable', 'disposable', 'container', 'sport', 'market', 'source', 'electrolyte', 'ounce', 'container', 'poured', 'serving', 'teenager', 'adult', 'impression', 'teen', 'athlete', 'drink', 'mention', 'potential', 'sport', 'result', 'negative', 'vote', 'drink', 'pineapple', 'flavor', 'strange', 'feeling', 'mouth', 'teen', 'coconut', 'water', 'residual', 'flavor', 'straw', 'package', 'opening', 'pouring', 'assistance', 'fork', 'sugar', 'water', 'bother', 'biggest', 'issue', 'waste', 'coconut', 'sugar', 'water', 'indonesia', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'container', 'symbol', 'milk', 'carton', 'difficult', 'community', 'landfill', 'line', 'sugar', 'water', 'transport', 'packaging', 'waste', 'culture', 'sustainability']",10

I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind.

691,"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.

It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.

This is all from the chia seeds you can see inside, which gives it a texture that is new and fun to drink. The seeds themselves absorb more than ten times their weight in water, so when you drink them they hold onto it, keeping you hydrated longer. Great for workouts and sports.

I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple/grape juice combo and light on the orange/tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9-year-old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks.

Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.  The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.

The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck.

Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame.","['proportion', 'drink', 'equal', 'regular', 'soda', 'calorie', 'sugar', 'content', 'regular', 'soda', 'stuff', 'slight', 'citrus', 'acidity', 'horrible', 'metal', 'sickly', 'sweetness', 'minute', 'ward', 'soda', 'water', 'natural', 'juice', 'refreshing', 'pleasant', 'refreshment', 'trait', 'drink', 'beverage', 'occasion', 'people', 'reaction', 'orange', 'crush', 'different', 'orange', 'soda', 'soda', 'water', 'soda', 'water', 'regular', 'orange', 'juice', 'treat', 'nasty', 'stuff']",10

3946,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.  Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.","['fan', 'all-natural', 'healthy', 'alternative', 'life', 'regular', 'soda', 'thing', 'artificial', 'color', 'sweetener', 'corn', 'yuck', 'risk', 'calorie', 'average', 'true', 'claim', 'artificial', 'juice', 'sparkling', 'water', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'particular', 'flavor', 'orange', 'tangerine', 'strong', 'citrus', 'drink', 'promise', 'orangy', 'citrus', 'apple', 'grape', 'juice', 'bold', 'beverage', 'mineral', 'water', 'bite', 'worse', 'clock', 'calorie', 'regular', 'coke', 'sugar', 'coke', 'sodium', 'regular', 'cola', 'c', 'kind', 'health', 'benefit', 'source', 'orange', 'overall', 'all-natural', 'health', 'pro', 'switch', 'orange', 'tangerine', 'high', 'calorie', 'carb', 'count', 'switch', 'beverage', 'better', 'sparkling', 'water', 'twist', 'orange', 'peel', 'healthy', 'alternative', 'traditional', 'soda']",10
3951,"It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.  Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.  In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.  As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk.

4098,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.  I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.

Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).
