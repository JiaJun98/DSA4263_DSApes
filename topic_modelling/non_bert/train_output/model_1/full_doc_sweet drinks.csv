Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.

I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind.

The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.  If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch.

281,"In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste.  Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)  There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.

Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.  I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.  Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.

It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.  The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.  They are also great in a stir fry.  The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.","['mushroom', 'lot', 'flavor', 'dish', 'mushroom', 'bland', 'boring', 'mushroom', 'shelf', 'life', 'mushroom', 'lot', 'flavor', 'shelf', 'life', 'year', 'ounce', 'package', 'equivalent', 'pound', 'water', 'hour', 'water', 'dish', 'flavor', 'flavor', 'mushroom', 'application', 'chanterelle', 'fungus', 'egg', 'stir', 'fungusamongus', 'brand']",3

875,"I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.  I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.","['vanilla', 'bean', 'year', 'ice', 'cream', 'supermarket', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'bean', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'feel', 'sign', 'freshness', 'seed', 'inside', 'bean', 'flavor', 'purchase', 'vanilla', 'aroma', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'bean', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'one', 'one', 'bit', 'bean', 'freshness', 'vanilla', 'bean', 'one']",3

988,"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.  The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.

1357,"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon).

2458,"Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.  However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.  Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed.

2478,"Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.  The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.  The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly.

2483,"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).

The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.

3007,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.","['celtic', 'game', 'friend', 'apartment', 'game', 'hey', 'brian', 'yeah', 'lavender', 'soda', 'fridge', 'lavender', 'soda', 'person', 'soda', 'couch', 'furniture', 'section', 'marshall', 'kitchen', 'lavender', 'soda', 'experience', 'scent', 'lavender', 'soap', 'soda', 'experience', 'sip', 'time', 'flavor', 'club', 'soda', 'glass', 'soap', 'cleaning', 'flavor', 'drinking', 'experience', 'case', 'soda', 'aftertaste', 'soap', 'residue', 'soap', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'memory', 'childhood', 'boy', 'mother', 'mouth', 'soap', 'word', 'disrespectful', 'father', 'mother', 'conviction', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'effect', 'year', 'flavor', 'soap', 'mouth', 'word', 'lavender', 'soda', 'flood', 'emotion', 'word', 'rule', 'vision', 'cloudy', 'control', 'motor', 'function', 'bluthering', 'mess', 'floor', 'memory', 'soda', 'episode', 'summary', 'soda', 'soap', 'palate']",3

Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.

I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups.

They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.  Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.  So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend.","['fan', 'organic', 'line', 'product', 'track', 'record', 'organization', 'pomegranate', 'licorice', 'package', 'fruit', 'scent', 'pomegranate', 'thing', 'color', 'thing', 'bat', 'licorice', 'stick', 'twizzler', 'residue', 'finger', 'aspect', 'licorice', 'sweet', 'smell', 'twizzlers', 'licorice', 'chewy', 'texture', 'trend', 'pomegranate', 'sugar', 'gelatin', 'flavor', 'pomegranate', 'grows', 'end', 'flavor', 'pomegranate', 'flavor', 'pomegranate', 'pom', 'juice', 'product', 'licorice', 'pom', 'juice', 'product', 'treat', 'share', 'family']",3
4119,"We used to raise Montmorency cherries, and these dried cherries are the real deal. As dried fruit, they're perfect: moist, chewy, and wonderfully flavorful. They make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office. Though I generally don't like added sugar on dried fruits, it's really necessary to counteract the cherries' naturally tart taste. Reconstituted, I'm guessing they'd be perfect for tart cherry pies. Certainly the flavor is everything I remember in a really good tart cherry pie, which is almost impossible to find these days.","['montmorency', 'cherry', 'cherry', 'deal', 'fruit', 'chewy', 'snack', 'office', 'sugar', 'fruit', 'cherry', 'guessing', 'tart', 'cherry', 'flavor', 'tart', 'cherry', 'pie', 'day']",3

4212,"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.  I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).  Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.  I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.  If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.","['march', 'coconut', 'milk', 'coconut', 'milk', 'layer', 'cream', 'case', 'end', 'subscription', 'plan', 'roland', 'coconut', 'case', 'content', 'can', 'time', 'coconut', 'milk', 'flavor', 'fond', 'layer', 'cream', 'thinner', 'consistency', 'product', 'coconut', 'milk', 'difference', 'can', 'thicker', 'non-subscription', 'can', 'copyright', 'thailand', 'watery', 'subscription', 'symbol', 'control', 'union', 'certification', 'copyright', 'can', 'ingredient', 'nutrition', 'information', 'problem', 'packaging', 'dent', 'can', 'packaging', 'subscription', 'mess', 'box', 'box', 'can', 'hole', 'result', 'fall', 'condition', 'lack', 'consistency', 'flavor', 'star', 'review']",3

4224,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).
