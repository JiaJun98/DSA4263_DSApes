"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence.",drinks

"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.  I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.   When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.",coffee

"I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.  I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste.

I am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs. I had ordered 2 boxes of these and when I opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out. The treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic. I could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in. They were also out of date by a couple of months. I contacted the the people that I purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund. I was very please with the seller's response.,dog

I drink a lot of teas and tisanes so I like to try different kinds from time to time. I've been drinking this for a few weeks and it's fantastic.

I highly recommend this.,tea

"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.",drinks

"This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also.",drinks
I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was broken and could not be used for the Seder.

Coffee is just as good as other Fair Trade coffees that I buy.  I have a One:One pod maker and these fit in them just fine.  I do like my coffee a little on the strong side and can use the pod to make a very big cup of coffee before tossing.  I would recommend this product.,coffee

"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product.",chips

"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!",coffee

"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.  The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!  I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!",cat
"These tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes, which is great! They are also very flavorful. I've been using them in a coconut curry and I don't even bother soaking them to soften them, I just throw 5 of them (five halves) in the vita-mix with everything but the coconut milk, blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk. Delicious! I originally purchased these because I had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that (the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they aren't organic) but 3 pounds is still so much I gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks I'm weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once I give him the coconut curry recipe he'll be thanking me.

The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.

"My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.

In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!  I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds. I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that! The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.  This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it.",coffee

If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.  My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it.

"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!!

"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?  I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 ""recycle"" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.",drinks

"I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high-fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the ""healthier"" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.  The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.",snacks

I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.  This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.  They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.  Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these.",coffee
"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.  I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.  Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!

"Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.

"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW  Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?  Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!  The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.  ~ Ana Mardoll",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.  When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).

I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.

They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.

"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.

"I love this stuff. I brew several pitchers of iced tea from it every day, and it has become my standard beverage. Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.  So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.  This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.

Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit.

"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)  Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""  Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.  Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.  So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:    * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)   * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces   * a combination of the above two factors   * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract   o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease   o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation   o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage  Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.  Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.  Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.  When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.    The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.  The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top  Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.  The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.  The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top  Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:    * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.   * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).    Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:    Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""    ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""    For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.    * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.   * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.   * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)   * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)  Top  Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:    * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.    The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.    * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.

Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles.""

These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months.  Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips.  They've got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer.  The bulk box of 15 bags is also the most economical purchase I've found.,chips
"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs! I've gone back to my old method...a wide-mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!",dog

I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.  The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.  If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.,drinks

The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.  Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion.",drinks

My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.

"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.  For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.  As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.

"In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste.  Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the ""tinny"" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)  There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as ""double concentrated."" As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.  But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. This has become a cooking essential in my kitchen.",flavor

Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's "" smoke point "". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect. If you have a Misto, this is a great oil to put in it! We will definitely keep this on hand.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.  I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.  I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all. If you like it, go ahead and order one of the regular-salted  Kraepelien & Holm Farm Salt Licorice, 2.2-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)  available on Amazon, making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer. Otherwise, you risk wasting your money on something you may consider inedible.",chips

When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.  Once that fades, the gum has a mellow, subtle, lime zest flavor.  I really like this gum.",flavor

"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.",dog

Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.  Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.

"What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it, but you don't know until you've tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.

I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.  This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.  I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.  As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! - However, definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box!",coffee
"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.  I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.  The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.  The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.

I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes. This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.",tea

Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.

"The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.  I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.  Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt.",flavor

"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,  What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.  If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!  So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff.

"If you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast, not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant, but the kind that hunters grab when they are together, thick, with lots of fat in the middle, you WILL enjoy these!

Now I must admit I am a wimpy, crispy kind of gal, and I like my bacon on the lean side, in fact with my allergies I have to use Morningstar Soy bacon (don't cringe!).

If you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning, this is the perfect selection for you. However, you might want to consider the  David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix  for a selection, or the milder and tamer  David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler .

I just made myself a cup of this coffee and I think I found a new favorite brand. When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar. I really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness. Definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee.,coffee

That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate.",carbohydrates_meal

"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.",carbohydrates_meal

I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.  Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky.

I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.

"This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product I'd order it again.  One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.  Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasn't truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st.",grocery

Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.,cat

"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.

It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!  Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.

But I can't buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories, so these candies seem to be ideal.",snacks

"If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a ""super bar"" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.",snacks

After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.  Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.  This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled) they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem.",baby_meal

It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.  I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.  My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.  I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.  For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.  We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.  A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.  So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.  I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.  Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",unknown

"So I bought these when I saw a great deal on deals.woot.com about a coupon they had and I had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge.  These are tasty, although sometimes a little hard for my taste, and a little higher in calories than I would like in a snack (200 calories per bag)  But, it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut, and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer. The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.  Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste.

I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).

I'm upset still.,tea
"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.  ~The Rebecca Review",tea

"I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in bricks to fill the box  -- this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!  These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.  I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!  They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.  I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make.",carbohydrates_meal

One that was sent in this deal was just a little curved, which makes it harder for their stumpy legs to hold while chewing, so they ""argue"" over who gets the un-bent one!

"I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)  Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",snacks

These little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious.  Being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor.

The price for each pack of 36 is good too (for now anyway).  I highly recommend these little (just 4 ounces) fruit cups.,grocery

We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,dog

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",cat

"Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.  The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.  They are also great in a stir fry.  The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.",flavor
"We've been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time, but this packaging is an great improvement. We first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder. The grinder was a pain in the wrist to use. I'm so glad that Weber now sells it pre-ground in a shake-on container. Plus, the grill-lid shaped cap is a cute touch. I definitely recommend this seasoning as it's just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal-grilled steak. I'd even use it on chicken or pork, as well.",flavor

"I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.  I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.",flavor

"I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty.",cat

"I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.  After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.  What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.  I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.  Enjoy  Ken",tea

Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.

"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.",snacks

According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.  FANTASTIC!!!",snacks

"As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good.",coffee

"This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.  The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.  However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.",flavor

"I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc.  This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest.  It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).

"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.",coffee

"I was surprised to finally see vegan baked goods on Amazon. I normally bake my own vegan baked goods but am always looking for products to try or send to my daughters in college. Because I do bake when I have time, I'm pretty picky and I have make pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, muffins, and carrot cake. Marge's  breads were outstanding! They were moist and not overly sweet. The icing on the carrot cake was delicious. They arrived in a couple of days as promised in a cute little basket which I'm using elsewhere now. I did freeze them as soon as they arrived and they held up beautifully. Since my order, I went directly to their website to order just the carrot cake. I wish Amazon would allow the option of only ordering three of the same breads. Thank you Marge's Bakery for making an outstanding product...thank you Amazon for finally carrying some vegan products--please continue to find these small businesses throughout our country!",dog

It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.  It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!",unknown
"I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!",chips
"I received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in. This isn't very surprising due to the type of plastic it's packaged in -the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture- but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully. Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it! That's just outrageous. Very very dissatisfied. I have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from Wilton  Wilton Sugar Pearls, White, 5 Oz  which incidentally, are less than half the price.  I should say, that generally my experience with Amazon and returns has been excellent. The few dragees left in the package were beautiful, uniform in shape and tasty.

"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.  The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.  The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.  Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.  This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it.",drinks

"I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars. The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.  At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!  Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!",tea

"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a tasty option when you need a quick microwave meal on the go. With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them. The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.  A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal. It's nicely layered into a small package that can easily fit into a purse or briefcase, but when you take the layers apart, you can't help but think of landfills or the great oceanic garbage patch.  All in all, this is still a decent option for days when you know you're going to be too busy to either go to the deli or make a sack lunch with bean curds to turn off any would-be fridge thieves.",snacks

There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.

I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a ""hot plastic-y"" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.",carbohydrates_meal

"I'm not smart enough to know enough about bottled water. I'm in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best.  Most bottled water strips the natural minerals out.  However, there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic.  A higher pH would be the opposite, so in that regard this should make this water much better.  Honestly I cannot tell the difference.  But I can say ther was no odor.  There was no bad aftertaste. But I cannot say if this is worth the price.",drinks
"This is a wonderful product, and I am not one who dines at Taco Bell. I used to eat there when I was younger in college, but have not in years, so I was pleased to try this product and find that it was great!  First, I like that the bottle is not so huge because the taste will stay fresh instead of getting stale from lack of use. I have many dressings and toppings etc. in my 'fridge, so it's nice to have a smaller bottle.  Second, the taste is excellent. I love the creamy texture, and it has just a little ""heat"" from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot.  I used this on a home made taco salad, but I also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish I made that was like a south of the border spaghetti - grandchildren like noodles, so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a Mexican style noodle dinner that they loved!

I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.

Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.  Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda.",drinks

It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors.

"With  Green Mountain Hot Cocoa  being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.  Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.  Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.  As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or "" Splenda "" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.  If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.",carbohydrates_meal

The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140.

"I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it's just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it's very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.  Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.  One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.  My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.",chips

"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.  Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.  Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!",drinks

Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.... before I whipped up a batch I figured Id do a little investigating to see if there was any input/ suggestions on the mix. WOW. Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from ""its great"" to ""its horrible""..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix. It has good elements to it (I like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty) and I think it COULD be really tasty.",carbohydrates_meal

"We picked some of these up this week. They're very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you're walking out the door. The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.  On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.  When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.  I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet.

The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods.

What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.  (4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.

The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added.

This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender.

"Wow, we've never had so much Macaroni and Cheese in a long time! And Annie's is really, really good. This doesn't need additional milk or butter, and the sauce is an easy-to-squeeze out paste in a foil package. It tastes great, and makes a great receptacle for some creativity of your own too.  Tips to enjoy it:  - Just boil in plenty of water, the six-cup requirement is a minimum.  - Drain quickly, put the pasta back in the hot pot. The remaining heat is just right to melt the thick cheesy sauce into the macaroni. Don't rinse the pasta in cold water, it will make it hard for the sauce to combine well.  - All the Deluxe versions are animal rennet free. Annie's FAQ is very specific about which ones use vegetable rennet (not all do) but Amazon isn't picking up the information. I tag the really vegetarian ones ""animal rennet-free"" whenever I can.  - Try blending sundried tomatoes, a fresh tomato, olive oil, garlic, pizza peppers, salt, freshly ground pepper, and a touch of balsamic vinegar into a paste. This really complements the mac and cheese and gives it a new, gourmet taste that still doesn't take away from the ""mac and cheesiness"" of it.  - Tabasco Chipotle sauce makes a great addition for the adventurous. The smoky taste is tempered by the creaminess.",healthy food

We like many different kinds of flavored hot tea and switch between drinking black or green iced tea (usually decaf and usually made as sun tea). Some of us add sweetener; some of us don't. We like peaches both fresh and canned. For these reasons, I can't blame our dislike of the taste on the simple fact that it is flavored and a green tea.

I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.

"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix.

"I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.  To me, ""French gray"" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.  One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.

"I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got! Cheers.",flavor

After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there.

I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.  FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.,unknown
This is very good. I am taking it because I have some gout at the tips of my toes. And I exercise intensely every day. So I want to protect my joints. It's part of my daily health regiment. It's got a good taste but the directions say take two tablespoons for a 6-8 oz glass. Seems too diluted for me so I put 3 tablespoons to a 8oz glass seems to taste better. I haven't tried taking just a tablespoon straight yet.,drinks
"Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters is a tasty snack that I enjoyed quite a bit.  It's not exactly health food, but I don't think there would be an issue in enjoying this treat in moderation.  Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters are made up of large granola clusters, too big to be eaten easily as a breakfast cereal but just the right size for snacking.  The most obvious ingredients are oats, almond bits, cocoa, and cinnamon.  Neither the cocoa or cinnamon taste is overpowering at all, and I found that the combination of these two tastes was much better than I would have expected.  Now as I mentioned above I would not consider this product health food, despite the claims on the package about the antioxidant power of the cocoa and cinnamon.  After all, a small serving contains 6 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar, and among the ingredients listed are brown sugar, palm oil, and evaporated sugar cane juice.  But as a substitute for more highly processed sweets this will do OK.  Overall I am a fan of Eat Think Smile Cinnamon Almond Granola Clusters and would likely buy it in the future.",snacks
Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months,snacks
"If your daily water consumption isnt at least 2.2L (for women; 3.3L for men) a day, then it really doesn't matter what kind of water you drink. Work on getting your consumption up to the minimum. If you are drinking upwards of a gallon of water a day, then picking a water of Atrisian type is greatly worth the health benefits. Also, plastic is quite detrimental to your health, so getting an item like Voss in the glass bottles instead of plastic is worth the price tag.  Otherwise just buy 1 glass bottle of Voss and reuse the bottle if you feel the need to impress your friends. Trust me, no one drinks Voss to impress anyone. People who do are morons and everyone around them already knows it.",baby_meal

My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more.

"Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.  I was excited about these, they looked like a ""grown up graham cracker"".  First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific. I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$.

I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.

My only problem with these chips is their texture. They're a bit thin, and there's not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out.",chips

What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed.

"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).  While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.  While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.  Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.  If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.",grocery

"When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":  Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food   Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts   My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.  I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.  I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!  But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.  Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!",cat

The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.  What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers.

I will begin to review all the flavors (except for cherry, I have not tried the cherry one) :  - Grape : This one is my favorite. It tastes almost like normal grape soda but you can still taste the real fruit juice. It leaves the after taste of real grape juice. The carbonation is about the right amount.  - Orange : My second favorite flavor. It was very yummy and taste very real. If you let a friend drink it, he/she will be able to tell it is made from real juice and not artificial flavor.  - Lemon lime : Great combination of flavors. The tartness is just right but the flavor is just ok, nothing impressive.  - Kiwi/berry & Watermelon/strawberry : I found these two too sweet. The kiwi/berries taste is too strong it almost reminds me of artificial flavors in candy.  - Cherry : I did not try this flavor but my boyfriend said it is his favorite and he loves it.  Bottom line : Get this variety pack to see what flavors you like. My bf and I both love carbonated drinks but stopped drinking regular soda a while ago due to high fructose corn syrup.

Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.  So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.  So I'm stuck with 11 packs.  See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them.",healthy food
"I take a spoonful of Coconut Manna every day. This is a blend of coconut oil and the coconut meat and it tastes sweet and yummy. Very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart, brain, hair, joints. I use regular coconut oil for cooking. Some people complain about it separating, which is true, but I use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle. Then it is easy to take a spoonful. You could gently heat it (in a pot of hot water) and then mix it up but I never heat it. I prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using, but I am happy it is Organic.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"This is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness.  I understand others' comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality.

Still, I like it.",drinks
"For just about $10, this canister gives you about 150-180 cups of coffee. That is just over a nickel a cup- you can't beat that! That means that for the same money as ""premium"" coffees like Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you can get 80 cups (assuming $4 a cup). If you took $4 a day for 5 days a week, for a year, you would be spending $1000 just on coffee alone, money you can save for a car or down payment.  Even if the Starbucks tastes a little better, is it really worth it?  This coffee does not taste as good as premium, but it does not taste bad either. So coffee afficionados would not be as let down as they think (and honestly that Starbucks Via stuff is way too expensive at $1 a cup).  Granted, instant is not as good as a really fresh cup of freshly ground coffee, but it tastes better than most coffee, because most coffee is not freshly ground (especially the pre-ground coffee in bricks or cans).  Because freeze dried retains freshness a longer time if it is kept air-sealed, you get a fresh cup almost every time.  There are only two big downsides to the 7 ounce containers.  1. First, by the time you get to the bottom of the canister, you might experience some staleness. This is because of exposure to air, which affects even freeze-dried coffee. One possible solution is to seal small batches and keep them away from light and heat.  2. It is easy to add too much instant coffee to a cup. It only takes a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half for one cup, nothing more.  It only takes a little to make a cup.  Overall, Nescafe Taster's Choice offers a great balance between cost savings and taste. Is it as good as fresh brewed? Perhaps not, especially if you can get freshly ground coffee that you make yourself.  But it is certainly better than most coffee you get at, say, a diner or restaurant.  Cafes make it better, but at $4+ a cup, they are not worth it unless just as an occasional indulgence.  If you are one of those people who has always scoffed at instant, I'd say at least give this a try.",coffee
"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites.  They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special.  The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been sprinkled on.  Some chips seem to have minimal flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most.  Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes.  I wish that these chips had more than just a ""hint"" of lime.",chips

"I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink.

"I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another ""name brand"" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.  I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)

The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.  This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes.

"I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.  I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants.

They even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month, 3 months, or 6 months and the price for a case is reasonable (especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free - just buying a case costs WAY too much with shipping).  I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.

In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.

At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.",grocery

"FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, "" A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China."" (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that ""small number"" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?  We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.",dog

Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.

It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc. My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her. I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.

"Those familiar with regular Oreos (and, really, who isn't?) won't find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter Oreo Fudge Cremes.  They consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme, then enrobed in a fudge coating.  The wafer is thin and nicely crispy.  The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that.  It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped.  The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness.  What else can really be said about an Oreo?  Although I might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense, I was still quite happy to nibble on them.  I certainly wouldn't mind doing so again.",snacks

"These are the only rose hips I've had in my life, so I don't have any standard of comparison.  Tastes good to me, though.  I became interested in these because of joint/gum problems and hearing that vitamin C could help with that.  I figured that bioflavonoids/other compounds may be important for absorbing vitamin C and I'd probably be better off getting it from a whole food than from a supplement (not that there's anything wrong with supplements - just my way of thinking!).  Anyway: I mostly use these for making 'soaked tea.'  Or just iced tea?  :D  Basically I just put a good amount of these in a bottle filled with a couple cups of water (around 3-4 tablespoons), shake it up, stick that in the refrigerator, then shake it up really well the next day when the rose hips are softened.  That's when the water takes on a rich orange/light amber color and noticeably thickens up (maybe from the pectin that I'm assuming is in the rose hips?), and also tastes great.  Shaking it really well helps to disperse all the flavor - keep that in mind.  I eat the rose hips too (after soaking overnight) and they taste good as well, but a little strong eating a lot of them.  I've made tea with them, and I enjoy that a lot, but I thought that heating it up so much would destroy a lot of the vitamin C.  If you're drinking it for enjoyment, it doesn't really matter what you do, and the rose hip tea I made with these rose hips tasted great.  You have to use a good amount of rose hips to get that tangy/sour flavor; for making 1 cup I'd at least use a couple tablespoons, but that's just me - everyone has their preferences.  Overall I think it's very pleasant and refreshing, though I prefer it unheated, and just ""soaked and shaken.""  I make kefir and adding these to the 'ripening under airlock' phase can make an interesting brew.  There's a lot you can do with these things, so don't be afraid to get creative.  As for this specific brand, as I said, it's the only one I've tried, so I don't have a standard of comparison -- but I'm satisfied with these, think they taste fine, and they were sold for a great price.  No complaints here :)",tea

The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!",snacks
"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.  While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",drinks

The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package.  The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it.

"Very happy with these beans - they're very fresh, very fragrant, and arrived quickly.  I used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as Christmas gifts:  I split all the beans lengthwise, and added them to a 750 mL bottle of vodka, shaking about once per week for several months.  To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.  The flavor is excellent, and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store.  Also, I put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister (leave them out to dry first!) for yummy vanilla sugar.  Highly recommended.",coffee

"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!",cat
"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter.

"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.",coffee

I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?

"This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.  As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.  I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.  I really want to like this company.

"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.  Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.  When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.  Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.",unknown

"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.  That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing.",carbohydrates_meal

"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.

So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.

I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.

They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth.

"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.  Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.",grocery

"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.   My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?

"First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.  I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.  I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.  I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.",coffee
"I have purchased the Zoe evoo in cans (regular and organic) many times in the past and been very satisfied.  I like this Zoe 100% arbequina evoo even better, as far as taste goes.  It is very flavorful, somewhat grassy with no bitter taste, and has a smooth, silky texture.  It is more of a rich yellow color than green.  It is a great all purpose oil that holds up to sauteeing, drizzling over cooked pasta, for use in salad dressings and for bread dipping.  It is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses, especially when purchased on subscription basis. This comes in a clear bottle, not my preference for storage of olive oils, so I have wrapped the bottles with foil to minimize light exposure and slow degradation.  Oils can also be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil
"My son is on a Gluten Free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category, and that taste good enough for him to eat...is very hard.  He loves these bars.  He thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could. They are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that.  These bars are on average, pretty expensive in the stores, but I can purchase them off Amazon for much cheaper and I usually buy them in bulk. If you have a picky eater, or if anyone is on a specific diet, these might be something to consider.

"These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.  There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.",snacks

I haven't compared a lot of other snacks, but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives. I guess because there's no other tastes that they have to mask, the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through. I don't normally worry about such things as health and nutrition, but 12 boxes is a lot, and I tend to chow down on a lot of them because they're so good!

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",baby_meal

"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""  Boo on Betty Crocker.",healthy food

"The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.  I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.  I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.  In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.  When I first opened the box at work, my co-workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum ""Big Red"".  When I got to the first sip I encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before I was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon.  It felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other.  Face-scrunching ensued.  I will not be finishing this box.",tea

"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.  The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids.",drinks

"These diet bars are very tasty with a nice flavor of dark chocolate and a pleasant, non-sticky crunch. With 6 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber to 6 grams of sugar and only 120 calories, they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of so-called diet products.  I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years both to loose weight and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.  Like some other programs, the first phase of the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening. These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program, or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time. I liked them, and my wife liked them, too.",snacks
"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.  The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...  Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.  The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.  And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.  The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.  But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",chips
"These are vaguely like a Payday, nuts stuck together with chewy sweet goodness, and something vaguely like Rice Crispies in there. They are saltier than I expected, though I like that.

I'm a big nut eater, so I do like these, and I like the salty sweet nutty sticky mess. But I think I'd prefer them w/o the cereal filler.",snacks

I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.  Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.  Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):  (1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)  (2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US  (3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)  (4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.

This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands.",flavor
"I enjoy Indian food but unfortunately the closest Indian restaurant is 150 miles away from my house. I've tried other commercial Indian food products and have not been very pleased. The Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry, however, is tasty, just spicy enough for me (well, maybe a little on the mild side), and easy to make. I buy the Costco rotisserie chicken, debone it, put it in 1 pound zip-lock bags, and freeze them. Each envelope of the Butter Curry needs 1 pound of chicken, so I just pop the chicken out of the freezer, defrost it, add the curry paste and butter, and in about 20 minutes I have a delicious dinner. I will definitely be ordering this product again.",unknown

"The Oatmeal Raisin bars by Quaker are a tasty treat, but unlike some bars, they aren't too sweet or too bland. They have enough sweentess to make them flavorful, but don't go to extremes. They are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to ""junk"" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent ""in between"" meals snack. In stores, it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of 10. I've tried a few of the others kinds made by Quaker Oats, but these are my favorites.",snacks

"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time. I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank. He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it! I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).  He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).  I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!",healthy food

He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product.

"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""  So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.  We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)  It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).  Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.",cat

I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.

"Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.",flavor

"My Japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black, pungent and quite frightening. HongCho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good! Don't let the ""vinegar"" scare you off - it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down. I guess it really depends on how much you dilute it. I believe the package says 1:3 for a strong taste or 1:4 or 1:5 for a lighter taste. I've tried both the Pomegranate and Blueberry flavors and they were both good. You can also mix the concentrate with milk, yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it.  The bottle recommends drinking after a work out, after a bath or before bed. The purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being, improvement in digestion, speeding up metabolism and skin benefits.

They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye.

I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.

"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.  The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it.",tea

"These sugar-free Russell Stover Cinnamon Bun Snack Bars didn't last long here!  If I had not known they were sugar-free, I'd never have guessed it.  The bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy, which I like.  They do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack.  The bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar-free snack bar. Each bar has only 100 calories.  Russell Stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free, and I intend to sample a lot more of them.  Highly recommend!",snacks

The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.

"Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.  However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.  Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.",flavor

Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china.

If you're looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend that you give this a shot.

"Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.  The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.  The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly. That said, it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way.",snacks

"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.  I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.  I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.  To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).  It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.  I also have envirokids to try next.",healthy food

"This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.  This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.  Much as I like this, since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that I eat, and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion, for now I will stick with my granola bars. But if portion control is not a concern, then this is a great snack.",snacks

So I am mixing 1/3 Melitta Colombian and 2/3 decaf. I substituted this for the other decaf I have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste. Very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has. The price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well. I don't care for the packaging, however. I couldn't get it open without cutting the top, and then I had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it, with all the mess that that entails.

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.  Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.

I'll probably edit this review sometime in the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL",flavor

"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.",carbohydrates_meal
I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.

I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.

The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.  Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.",unknown

Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.

The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.,dog

Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.  The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.  What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.

"My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.",grocery

I have never used Gluten free pasta before. I absolutely love this pasta. I enjoy eating spaghetti once in a while and this satisfies that craving. It is very important to make sure the water is boiling prior to putting in the pasta.

I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.,healthy food

The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.

I just could not see paying $14 for a simple noodle dish. As an experiment, I bought one package of soba noodles, and one $3 package of Udon to see if the soba noodles were really necessary. The soba noodles were significantly better for this dish, so I was resigned to have to pay so much for my yummy dish.

Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.

The noddle's in this Yakisoba have a different flavor and texture then what I am use to in the ramen packets that I normally eat but are very tasty. As with most of these type products it is easy to prepare and the flavor can be adjusted to your taste by the amount of seasoning used.   I reason for only 4 stars has to do with the container that is used. After it is cooked in the microwave and the lid is peeled off there is a sticky adhesive left around lip. Not a problem if you are going pour the contents into a bowl but kind of gets in the way when eating directly from the container.,flavor

I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box.

"Narnia???  I first had Turkish delight while I was in Turkey.  There, shops produce Turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh.  Every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. The sweetness of Turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box.  I think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative.  If you can't fit a quick trip Turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute I've tried.  I wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and I wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through Amazon I trust.  Tangentially, if you like Turkish delight, you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin, because there's many other delicious Turkish confections you probably haven't experienced.",carbohydrates_meal

And packaged in envelopes - see  Sugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  - it's wonderful stuff.  But not in this packaging.  If you don't use the whole 12 pounds right away, the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock.  Have to microwave them, pound them with a hammer, and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear - e.g.,  JBK Bear Terra Cotta Brown Sugar Saver  - to make it possible to use it.

I admit, it's not the best-tasting sweetener, but I suppose it's the healthiest alternative (so far as we know anyways), thus it's the one I use. I use to use Equal many years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out it was a neurotoxin. Then I started using Splenda, which is the best in my opinion as far as taste goes. But now you hear about it not being that great either (healthwise), being chlorinated and all, so I stopped using it. Then I tried Truvia. Like I said, it's not the best - it does leave a bit of an aftertaste with tea, and using it for whipped cream did not work at all, I ended up having to add a bunch of powdered sugar to the cream to make it edible. I primarily use it to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries, as I still need a touch of sweetness, so one packet is great, tastes good. I also use it for my other low carb dessert - 2-3 oz cream cheese with a few berries and one packet of Truvia, also good.",tea

"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips.

I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.  So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?  Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.  I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.  In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.  Pam T~ mom/blogger/brownie baker",chips

The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.  There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?

After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.

"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):  Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)  )",chips

"A brother in a Sicilian family who owns an Italian Food Market & Deli here in San Diego, tipped me off to this product over a year ago.  The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The product is not widely known but the laboratories at Academia Barilla in Italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion, it is the very best.  The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.  Use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience.

"These sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket (usually the David's brand in my area) so there's more inner seed to eat.  There's also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them, so while there's enough salt to make things tasty, your lips aren't going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand.  The shells are easy to crack with your teeth, and they break cleanly; also the bags are filled with full-shelled seeds - there are very few broken ones.

"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my  Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold  for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter  Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6) and filter cone (similar to this one: Ready Set Joe/Mug ) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.  Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!",coffee

I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.",flavor
"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.

A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments. If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste.

"In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.  All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.  I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights.",drinks

This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".  What difference does it make?

I used to be able to buy this in the grocery stores but no longer.  I don't know why since it's the best pepper out there for cooking and flavoring.

"These are to potato chips as Pringles are to chips; as instant coffee is to brewed coffee; and Stephen Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin - same family but scant resemblance.

Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.

"My mom loved iced coffee.  Living in Sacramento, hot coffee just isn't appealing when its 110 outside.  But you want your coffee fix.  So, she brewed up a whole pot of coffee using the 60s version of the coffee maker, the percolator coffee maker.  The coffee wasn't that good, but you could make a lot of it, and then refrigerate it, pour it over ice, and sweeten and cream it to taste.  Yumm!  Starbucks makes it easier.  You just purchase the Frappuccino Mocha, pop it into the refrigerator, let it cool down, pour it over ice, and you have delicious iced coffee, sweetened and creamed just how I like it.  What's not to like?  It is expensive.  But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.  It's really more of an indulgence than a necessity.  I like to have a couple of bottles in the 'fridge during the summer, for those times when I want something cold to drink, but don't want to have a soft drink.  Iced coffee sometimes is just what you want.  Moderately Highly Recommended.  Five stars for taste, five stars for the convenience, three stars for the price.  Over-all, a winner.",coffee

"I just got home from a long trip and was faced with making dinner.  Luckily, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillet dinner was sitting in my pantry.  I browned a pound of chicken breast strips and followed the directions.  It was a quick and easy dinner for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  The ingredients come in 4 different packets - the pasta (orzo I think), seasonings, dehyrated broccoli and Velveeta cheese sauce.  After browning the chicken, just add the seasoning and pasta along with about 2 1/2 cups of water and cover.  In about 7 or 8 minutes, add the dehydrated broccoli and cook another 2-3 minutes.  Then remove from heat and add the cheese sauce.  My kids loved it and there was plenty for everyone.  I found it to be better tasting than Chicken Helper and easier to prepare.  My only complaint was the miniscule amount of broccoli.  It was more like a sprinkling of dried parsley than broccoli florets.  Of course, you can always add your own fresh or frozen broccoli or other veggies to make it healthier and heartier.  Overall, a good choice for a hectic night when you don't have much time to cook and a lot of hungry little mouths to feed.",carbohydrates_meal

"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!  First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!  Not a good buy IMO.

They advised that this is a new product and only available to date in the Midwest basically, but that I could order through Amazon! I am thrilled!

"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.  ""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""  ""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""  ""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""  ""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.  I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.  When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...  You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.  In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.",flavor

"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.  First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.  Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.  I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?",flavor

It did take me a few cups to get used to the taste. Now, I really enjoy the taste. I even miss it when I skip my nightly cup. I find it also relaxes me before bed. It is sweet enough that there is no need to add honey or other sweetener. The blueberry is an added bonus! I am willing to pay the steep price because I am trying to find something beside prescription medication to help control my out-of-control blood pressure. The price on Amazon is a bit higher than at Whole Foods where I shop.",tea
"I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un-popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.  I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.  We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.  I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.  *Update* 8/25/11  Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.  While cooking, you will swear you are in the movie theater!",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.

"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.

Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.  The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.  And the chocolate square is nummy. :D  The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.

"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.  So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down.",unknown

FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]",dog

"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.

"These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful..

"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.  Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.  I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.  The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]  When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)  Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.  The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.  I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee.",grocery

Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.

I did however find one negative review saying that theobromide, the primary stimulant in cocoa, is unhealthy and has similar side-effects as caffeine. I got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself. While I did have a small crash afterwards (after 3 tablespoons), the surge in energy that I felt was definitely worth it. It was not the jittery surge I was warned about, and the crash actually helps me sleep if I time it right. Not to mention the taste is so good (and yet mild) that I could eat it by the spoonful on its own. Thinking that was the end of it, I also ordered cocoa nibs. Terrible mistake. I don't know exactly why, but I got the exact side-effects I was warned about, not to mention the energy was lower in quality. This is definitely the better alternative.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.

"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag. I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices.

"I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.  Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent.",chips
"I'm not a big health freak and love soda and everything sugary and bad for you, but this stuff is incredible. Many people want to compare this to Izze, but Izze is only 70% compared to The Switch's 100%. And you can taste the difference in how natural the product is. Since I bought this to give up soda, the fizziness gives your brain a feeling that it's the same unhealthy soda you normally have, but the rest of your body will feel the difference. It definitely costs a bit more that a 24 pack of soda, but compared to Naked juice (the other delicious 100% juice beverage) it's a bargain deal.",drinks

"We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his ""treat"", looked at it as if to say, ""You've GOT to be KIDDING!"" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.  I like the fact that these are low-fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, ""Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter.""",dog

Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there's some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see ""plain"". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty ""flavor"" added to them.",flavor

With 70% of the USRDA of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses, she can very easily get the iron she needs.  This is not in any way hard on her stomach, either.  It tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried - a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content.  Blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients.

They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal.  Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein.  Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein.  The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well.  Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.

Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.  I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.

"This is a good product and very high-quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic), it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value. We've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk. Abbott labs (product maker) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in-place, published research, and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community (exacting standards). That said, I would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula (ie. other organic products suggested as ""better"" in these reviews - especially the referenced small-name organic powders). All said and done, the components in ALL of the Similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well-researched in published studies. I'd trust this brand - Similac, over the smaller, no-names. Plain and simple. Keep in mind it's what best suits your baby and with nascent/developing GI tracts, ALL babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source (even breastmilk). It's sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians/physicians.

"I am pleased with this salad dressing. The olive oil flavor comes through nicely. I have used this salad dressing on regular garden type salads and it tastes like home made dressing. I have also used in pasta salad and it adds a zesty taste. Using this olive oil based dressing is a good marinade for meats, chicken or even veggies, especially if grilling. There is a good balance between the herbs and olive oil to make this salad dressing taste good in different types of food. If you like vinegrette, you will find many uses for this product.

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",dog

"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",chips

You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.

"Like many other reviewers, I first found these apple chips at Costco, who has since discontinued them.

I eat them as a snack (I keep a bag at the office for this purpose) and I also use them as treats for my pet bunny (he goes absolutely bonkers for them).

"My favorite sweeteners are stevia and agave.  This Organic stevia has a bit of taste of both.  The main ingredient is agave inulin and then the second one is stevia.  This makes it really sweet with no aftertaste.  In fact, you can say that it almost has a hint of honey (must be the agave inulin)  It dissolves quickly too.  A packet equals 2 tsp of sugar.  I like 1 tsp in my cup of coffe so I use only half a packet at a time.  It is very good though.  Considering that it is organic and natural, the price is slightly above what I would pay, but I think it's ok if you're used to buying other products with stevia.  Truvia costs about 50 cents less than this organic stevia at about the same number of packets, but truvia is not organic.  So it depends on what you're looking for.",grocery

"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.  White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.  I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins).",tea

"When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's.  Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste. Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered. It was from the Post people, perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past.... One could only hope.  It the parking lot of the Grocery, I cracked open the box to give it a taste. Instantly I was transported back to my childhood, munching on cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons, the road runner, bugs bunny, it all came back...

"This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had.  I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside).  I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.  When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.  I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!

Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.

"This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.",coffee

I was very happy with this product.  Coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish. I ordered this in February (the cooler part of the year) and it arrived in perfect condition.  Some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place.  This is probably due to the product becoming liquid at 76 degrees.  My oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem.

I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.  This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.

The only downside is they are a bit pricey but that sometimes happens when a company is first to market with a compelling product.

I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.  The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.  Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)  I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.  UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime.

Black, it tastes pretty similar to the Republic of Tea Vanilla Almond flavor, which I also like.

So I wasn't sure what to expect when I drank this.  To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild - it's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you won't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo  - stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesn't like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.  I'm not sure when you would drink this though - it's a small can and I can't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead - especially at the price they charge for this.

I received my box of Pure Natural Bars right before going on a long road trip. I took several of the bars with me hoping that they would satisfy my hunger pangs while I traveled. I am pleased to report that these little snack bars did a great job of keeping my tummy happy and I didn't feel like I was eating something packed with preservatives or artificial ingredients. The mixture of fruits and nuts provides a sweet and nutty flavor experience that is a nice change from other bland or over-sweetened snack bars.  Pros: - Natural Ingredients - Pleasant Texture - Great Taste  Cons: - Wrapper is a little difficult to remove due to bars being slightly sticky  Overall I recommend these snack bars for anyone who wants a convenient snack on the go without feeling guilty about artificial ingredients.,snacks
"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index.

"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ¬Ω year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ¬Ω years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.   Karl and Lori  Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.",dog

"Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):  Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.  If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.  My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her. What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her.

"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.  I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.  I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.

"I really like Virginia Diner unsalted peanuts, so I decided to give this flavor a try.  The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.  If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).  Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.  This type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy, and they were.  The nuts are small, and mostly in halves.  There are a few fragments, but not many.",carbohydrates_meal

"at first, i thought i wouldn't like these.  i like fig newtons but i don't love them.  however, i couldn't be more pleased.  first of all, my first bite tasted like an oatmeal cookie.  i immediately checked the ingredients and yep, there's oats in there !  absolutely delicious. there are bits and pieces of fig scattered throughout the cookie or thin but it's not like a spread.  now i am not sure if  it's supposed to be spread between 2 thins but its like spots of fig here and there and the fig is kinda hard and chewy but fortunately or unfortunatley, there is very little fig so it's not that big of a deal.  i couldn't taste the honey but that's ok. i absolutely love oatmeal cookies and it tasted like that.  they are a nice size and crisp.  i dunked them in my tea and they were delicious.  my hubby hates fig and i slipped these in his lunch and he loved them too.  he didn't even taste the fig. these are very good however, if you really really want to taste fig, get the regular fig newtons.",tea

"A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.  I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.

"Pros: No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving) No added salt (30 mg per serving) Great taste Organic No stirring needed  Cons: Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping) Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter') A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving)  This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety.  It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.  We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a ""no added sugar"" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.  Amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems (USPS).",snacks

"I have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it's all about price. Kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though, so, always a good place to start.  Since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something I eat every day I really don't find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next. This Kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with *important consideration* for comparisons being fair, i.e of the same color+grade. I did not find this to be thinner than other brands either.  Great on pancakes, waffles, crepes, aebleskiver.

"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.   My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs of the tender beef spinach. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too? For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",grocery

"I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.  Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.  It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.  It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,  If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.  Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were.

"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.  TRY THIS INSTEAD:  Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag",cat

I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory.

"I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.  The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.  What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.",drinks

"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.

"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.  It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".  To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.  And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst.",flavor

"In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.  Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.  I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.  Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame.",drinks

"I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.  Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1"" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.  These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.",chips

"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.  Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.",drinks

"It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.  Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.  In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.  As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Holicks, it's just a great comfort drink.",drinks

"I am an experienced cook but new to Indian, so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters.  This was out of stock at the time I wanted it, so I contacted the Ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook (who signed my book) at their west coast CA restaurant--and it was shipped promptly the next day and I rec'd it two days later...mind you, I am on the east coast, in NY. I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.  All in all, as a beginner of Indian cooking, this was an economical and practical way to try almost 100% of the necessary spices needed for ANY cookbook of Indian cuisine.

Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

"I have been using Walden Farms products since the company came to North America and they are a regular part of my shopping list. Their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic. This is so versatile and great on Salmon (maple glazed), chicken, turkey etc, in chili and stews instead of molasses, great in butternut/carrot/pumpkin pureed soups, in milkshakes, on toast (french toast, biscuits, bread puddings, or breakfast bakes, on eggs, pancakes, high-fiber cereal, in puddings, hot and cold cereals, desserts, ice cream souffles,and in steamed milk and hot coffee! This is great on waffles, or to bake with (great for cakes/muffins etc); I love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in. I especially love mixing it into Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl, but healthy. Great way to have flavor without the added sugar.",flavor

I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.

"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",grocery

This is probably the best tea I have had and this brand is always a winner.  So far I am still perfecting my taste with this particular tea but while I am experimenting looking for my perfect taste I have found it to be great weak or strong.  Depending on my mood I like strong tea sometimes but not bitter which can be a problem for tea whether to much or to little is used.  My advice would be perfect before you rate because you may just be making it wrong since I usually let my tea set longer than what is recommended to get my taste and my taste is different than anyone in my family.  They usually claim it is too strong with how much I use but for me it is perfect.  This is a pack of six so make sure you will like this kind before purchasing.,tea

"Right. I know what you're going to say: it's granola.  How exciting can granola be?  This stuff is delicious. Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.  If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!",chips

"I've been feeding Wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. I believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of Wellness has been prohibitive. I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae.",cat
"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.  The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.  I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.",drinks
"I like it!  It's got the same after taste as the granulated, if you're wondering.  I find it pleasant.  Used it in coffee today and it was the perfect sweetness (and actually once it was in coffee, to me it was the same flavor as sugar - with no aftertaste). I don't like splenda very much and can't stand sweet n low. Been using stevia for a few months and got this to stir into yogurt. Excited!  Didn't realize it had to be refrigerated, but that was just my own ignorance.  Was hesitant, but now I highly recommend the SweetLeaf stevia clear!",coffee

"I am already a fan of Newman's Own Organics line of products.  I think they are generally high quality, reasonably priced and have a great track record as a charitable organization.  So, I was really looking forward to trying out the Pomegranate Licorice.  When you first open the package, you can immediately smell the sweet sugary fruit scent of pomegranate.  The next thing you notice is the rich red, well pomegranate, color.  One thing I liked right off the bat is that the licorice sticks are not super long like a Twizzler.  They are shorter and more manageable to eat.  They are a also not overly sticky and do not leave a sticky residue on your fingers.  Taste wise, they are great.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of this licorice is that they are not super sweet.  While they have a strong sugary smell, they are not obnoxiously sweet like Twizzlers.  The licorice has a nice chewy texture and trends towards soft.  The pomegranate taste is subtle.  At first you cannot taste it at all, instead tasting the sugar and gelatin flavors.  As you chew the pomegranate taste grows and by the end has a nice strong flavor.  The pomegranate flavor is also very good.  I haven't ate too many raw pomegranates but I do like the POM juice products.  This licorice compares well against the POM juice products.  So, as a nice treat to share with the family, I highly recommend.",flavor

"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]",dog

"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.  By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.",tea
"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.  I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).  Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.  I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.  If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review.",chocolate_milk_nuts_oil

"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!  To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).  Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).  My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver.",drinks

I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.  I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in.

You can find the good stuff at:  Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)   Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.  In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months.

"I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:  Me:  opening the bag ""you want a treat?"" Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"".  She looks back up at me.  ""sniff"".  She walks away and lays down in her bed. Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.

The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.

"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.",snacks

"If you are already a fan of illy coffee in general (whole bean, ground, espresso), most likely you'll enjoy this can of Cappucino Coffee.  The flavor of this drink is heavy on coffee with light milk (lowfat) added. The bitterness of the coffee is only lightly offset by the milk, so hopefully if you decide on this drink, it will be for a coffee flavor and not a more milky coffee flavor. There is also a hint of sweetness though I did notice that the sweetness seems to be closer to the bottom of the can. The can indicates that it shouldn't be shaken, so maybe this is expected?  There are 100 calories per can and gave me a decent caffeine jolt.  The can indicates this is a product of Denmark and is distributed by the Coca Cola company. The weird part here is that illy is an Italian brand... guess it costs too much to import from Italy? No idea there.  I only received one can as part of the Vine program, but have purchased single serve cans of this on my own and will, without doubt, purchase further cans of it.",coffee

If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.  This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version.",flavor

Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.
