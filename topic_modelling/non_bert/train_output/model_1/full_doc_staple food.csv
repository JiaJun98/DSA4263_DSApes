Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.  Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.

That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!

527,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor.

These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.  I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!

916,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

One time I used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time, I used it for a topping on taco night in my house.  Both times, my friends and family said it was too spicy for them.  I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.  So, if you like spice but not heat, this is a great sauce. There are many, many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish.

1158,"With  Green Mountain Hot Cocoa  being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.  Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.  Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.  As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or "" Splenda "" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  ""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.  What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers.

2428,"I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.

I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled.

2938,"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!  First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!  Not a good buy IMO.

Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.  The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.  And the chocolate square is nummy. :D  The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.  The plus sides are that it is portable, it's tasty and it's quite handy.  Will I buy it again?  I think so, honestly.

3706,"I really like Virginia Diner unsalted peanuts, so I decided to give this flavor a try.  The name ""Old Bay"" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.  If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).  Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.  This type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy, and they were.  The nuts are small, and mostly in halves.  There are a few fragments, but not many.","['virginia', 'diner', 'peanut', 'flavor', 'try', 'old', 'bay', 'refers', 'seasoning', 'seafood', 'familiar', 'idea', 'bay', 'leaf', 'doo-dads', 'snack', 'mix', 'peanut', 'familiar', 'peanut', 'mix', 'chex', 'party', 'mix', 'nut', 'perfect', 'virginia', 'diner', 'product', 'nut', 'foil', 'seal', 'content', 'seal', 'air', 'rush', 'type', 'packaging', 'nut', 'fresh', 'crunchy', 'nut', 'small', 'half', 'fragment']",11

3910,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.","['ok', 'bisquick', 'gf', 'thing', 'drop', 'box', 'kind', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'result', 'gf', 'bisquick', 'original', 'tart', 'original', 'similar', 'buttermilk', 'buttermilk', 'milk', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'odd', 'problem', 'new', 'mix', 'right', 'box', 'cup', 'mix', 'box', 'serving', 'cup', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'cup', 'mix', 'teaspoonful', 'measuring', 'cup', 'cup', 'mix', 'bag', 'mix', 'wheat', 'flour', 'kind', 'flour', 'measure', 'bag', 'cup', 'recipe', 'misprint', 'box', 'biscuit', 'gravy', 'butter', 'jam', 'yummy', 'mcdonald', 'breakfast', 'sandwich', 'instruction', 'lot', 'biscuit', 'single', 'recipe', 'half', 'plenty', 'box', 'mix', 'cost', 'box', 'biscuit', 'budget', 'biscuit', 'golden', 'recipe', 'egg', 'crumbly', 'glutenous', 'one', 'egg', 'eye-appealing', 'color', 'drop', 'biscuit', 'cut-in', 'shortening', 'cutter', 'long', 'fork', 'difficult', 'celiac', 'biscuit', 'cutter', 'box', 'biscuit', 'recipe', 'milk', 'tart', 'reminiscent', 'original', 'bisquick', 'mix', 'rice', 'flour', 'sugar', 'potato', 'starch', 'salt', 'xanthum', 'mix', 'goody', 'rice', 'flour', 'grainy', 'bisquick', 'fantastic', 'job', 'rice', 'flour', 'repeat', 'new', 'starch', 'corn', 'potato', 'tapioca', 'normal', 'lightness', 'baked', 'item', 'possible', 'rice', 'leavening', 'soda', 'powder', 'necessary', 'sugar', 'salt', 'flavor', 'consistency', 'yes', 'necessary', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'natural', 'ingredient', 'celiac-safe', 'baked', 'good', 'bit', 'elasticity', 'replacement', 'gluten', 'xanthum', 'gum', 'baked', 'goodie', 'people', 'celiac', 'disease', 'mix', 'money', 'sure', 'difficult', 'time', 'ground', 'rice', 'flour', 'predominant', 'main', 'ingredient', 'mix', 'recipe', 'box', 'pancake', 'waffle', 'shortcake', 'crust', 'ultimate', 'chicken', 'finger', 'chicken', 'recipe', 'website', 'mix', 'box', 'price']",11

4231,"All the Wylers singles to go are great!  They taste good and mix easily in bottled water.  Most places are overcharging for this item.  Walgreen's sells a package of 8 for $1.00 (or less; It was $0.59 a package of 8 over memorial day).  Most of my boxes had printing on the box indicating $1.00 per box.  I see some places charging over $2 per box.  At that rate, you can buy a 12 ounce can of soda (even big brands when they are on special,) and you get the can and the water included!

4268,"These graham crackers  are everything you'd want and expect of an all natural graham cracker.  They taste great with and fit right in with our family who go through a box a graham crackers on any given week.  These weren't quite as ""tough"" as our usual brand of grahams with a few more broken crackers and they definitely don't stay fresh up as on the counter if you forget to seal up the zip lock.  I think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and I don't think they really detract from the product at all.
