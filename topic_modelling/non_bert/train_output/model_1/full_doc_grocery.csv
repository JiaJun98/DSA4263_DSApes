7,"I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.  I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it","['hair', 'wonder', 'hair', 'brand', 'brand', 'teaspoon', 'coconut', 'oil', 'wonder', 'hair', 'price', 'vitacost', 'coconut', 'oil', 'stuff', 'stir', 'veggie', 'burger', 'chicken', 'oil', 'brand', 'beat', 'brand', 'market', 'value', 'skin', 'winter', 'month', 'shea', 'butter', 'skin']",8

131,"Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW  Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?  Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!  The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.  ~ Ana Mardoll","['pasta', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'parma', 'rosa', 'tomato', 'mix', 'love', 'sauce', 'pasta', 'alfredo', 'sauce', 'sauce', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'acid', 'reflux', 'spaghetti', 'meatball', 'life', 'eh', 'sauce', 'aisle', 'knorr', 'packet', 'rosa', 'sauce', 'idea', 'sauce', 'reviewer', 'tomato', 'alfredo', 'tomato', 'acid', 'content', 'stomach', 'eating', 'rosa', 'knorr', 'sauce', 'instruction', 'milk', 'mix', 'packet', 'reason', 'packet', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'versus', 'jar', 'mean', 'price', 'market', 'parma', 'rosa', 'pound', 'ground', 'beef', 'portion', 'meal', 'sauce', 'packet', 'sauce', 'store', 'fridge', 'person', 'leftover', 'mardoll']",8

However I loved it the most with vegetarian meat (I'm a vegetarian, living healthy and all *grins*), and this sauce is amazing in a veggie sandwich, or with cooked vegetarian meat.

202,"I was not expecting much from this, a disposable package of self-boiling pasta with a bag of meat sauce. There should be no way it can work. But it does! You fill cover the slightly oily pasta with water, leave on the drainer top, microwave it for 3 minutes, drain it, heat the sauce, and mix it all up. And amazingly, it tasted good! Normally I can't stand this zero-effort lazy style of cooking microwaved meals, but this was actually really tasty. I would not make this a part of my regular routine because of the price, but I can imagine people who would.  I have to take issue with the packaging, though. I am giving this four stars because each serving is individually packaged, and none of it is recycleable.

927,"This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).  It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the ""cheese"" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it ""good"" fat in either one).  It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!  But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.","['sort', 'thing', 'pleasure', 'brand', 'doubt', 'competitor', 'sauce', 'milk', 'toss-up', 'term', 'nutrition', 'champ', 'calorie', 'calorie', 'mg', 'sodium', 'kraft', 'velveeta', 'cheesy', 'skillet', 'protein', 'g', 'g', 'fiber', 'g', 'gram', 'competitor', 'difference', 'sauce', 'edge', 'fat', 'g', 'ground', 'beef', 'difference', 'fat', 'brand', 'transfat', 'list', 'oil', 'ingredient', 'disclosure', 'package', 'cup', 'dinner', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'g', 'transfat', 'fat', 'ground', 'beef', 'gram', 'sodium', 'meal', 'value', 'sodium', 'pleasure', 'definition', 'choice', 'case', 'thing', 'price', 'availability']",8

I should say, that generally my experience with Amazon and returns has been excellent. The few dragees left in the package were beautiful, uniform in shape and tasty. I view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product/its packaging. However it could have been handled better.","['item', 'tear', 'packaging', 'dragee', 'inside', 'box', 'type', 'plastic', 'sort', 'wrap', 'item', 'way', 'pearl', 'dagrees', 'wilton', 'wilton', 'sugar', 'pearl', 'price', 'experience', 'return', 'dragee', 'package', 'uniform', 'shape', 'incident', 'characteristic', 'packaging']",8

1064,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

With their compact, nonperishable packaging, these things are perfect for carrying to the office in your purse so the office cadger won't steal them.

A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg.

The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.  One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.

I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.  I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.  PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants. Bemuzing, to say the least.","['prune', 'diet', 'food', 'source', 'antioxidant', 'b', 'sugar', 'substitute', 'craving', 'um', 'constipation', 'couple', 'time', 'problem', 'limit', 'banana', 'raisin', 'raisin', 'raisin', 'antioxidant', 'fact', 'prune', 'half', 'kind', 'prune', 'sunsweet', 'consistency', 'cardboard', 'thim', 'fridge', 'couple', 'week', 'room', 'temperature', 'surprise', 'store', 'canister', 'buck', 'page', 'sort', 'error', 'price', 'time', 'bottomline', 'sort', 'prune', 'grocery', 'store', 'fact', 'time', 'sale', 'two-seventy', 'piece', 'drugstore', 'price', 'bit', 'price', 'subscription', 'discount', 'price', 'racket', 'p', 'trader', 'joe', 'prune', 'plastic', 'bag', 'pound', 'oz', 'two-eighty-nine', 'tenth', 'guy']",8

Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail.

I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.  With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.  The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.  I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.  Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!  Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again.

4194,"These are really good and healthy. Use the ""Subscribe & Save"" option because you can always have them skip a shipment (or cancel whenever). Watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly.

4196,"This is a great product and my daughter loves them. She's been eating them since she was 9 months old. However, this is extremely overpriced. They're $2 a pack at Publix. $6.24 a pack is nuts.","['daughter', 'month', 'pack', 'publix', 'pack', 'nut']",8
4203,"First of all, I just want to say that I hate lollipops. And I do mean HATE. Even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar. I got these originally because I was intrigued by the organic label. I love that you can actually understand what's in these items and they have a video showing it being made. Great unique taste as well. Definitely well worth the price! My family and friends love it. The assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that's out there.","['lollipop', 'dumdum', 'sugar', 'label', 'item', 'video', 'price', 'family', 'friend', 'assortment', 'thing', 'lot', 'candy']",8
4205,"I have been eating this for years but it is hard to find in the regular grocery stores so I purchased it over the web.  It is great for a fast, tasty meal.

4209,"Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese. It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)  The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.  The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired. I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..  Will shy away from this product.","['item', 'japan', 'import', 'costco', 'price', 'label', 'costco', 'price', 'expiration', 'date', 'mochi']",8

4244,"These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right ""kick"",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.  Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price.","['kind', 'chip', 'bland', 'kick', 'crisp', 'texture', 'health', 'food', 'sodium', 'content', 'food', 'chip', 'dip', 'vegetable', 'snack', 'shop', 'price', 'price', 'oz', 'bag', 'supermarket', 'pay', 'sale', 'price', 'manufacturer', 'price']",8

4280,"They used to carry a large jar of this at a local store, but I never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened. It is delicious with brie on a cracker (though I found out I am allergic to dairy so no more for me!) but it can also be used as a glaze, eaten on french bread, toast or in spoonfuls from the jar!

4282,"This was my first time eating Pad Thai favored anything. These were the very thin noodles if I remember correctly.

4284,"I was skeptical when i first purchased this because i got it pretty cheap and i'm used to buying pretty pricey stuff at the store.  But it's actually pretty good!

4287,"I add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium.  It clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender, but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non-organic milk.

4302,"""Dead Heat"" is the finest quality ""Gucci"" hot sauce I've ever tried.  And I'm an experienced hot sauce aficionado.  It's hot enough to be powerul (use one drop at a time), yet not so hot as to be dangerous to the touch or unusuable for cooking.  People who make hot wings at home, and who are looking for a superior hot sauce to add a measured heat to your wings...this is your sauce!

I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.  But what happened to the price? Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that.
