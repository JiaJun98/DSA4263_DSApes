"I bought this after my local coffee house went out of  business and it helped me so much with the transition to a coffee free world.  The mocha mix has a lot of sugar and ingredients I'd rather not have on a daily basis, but oh, it tastes wonderful, so for an occasional treat, it's awesome.  I add a small amount to a healthier protein shake and it makes for a great desert.",coffee
"I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee.",coffee
this is a really good thing to do if you drink coffee and use creamer. The price with subscrib & save saves you almost a 1.00 a container. try it you'll like it and its deliveried to you,coffee
Love this coffee . No problems brewing .Cannot beat the price realy good coffee and afordable.customer service was top notch .We raise our coffee cup to you,coffee
"Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!",coffee
"This is the first cold coffee drink (without crushed ice, like a Frappuccino at Starbucks) I have ever had.  I do enjoy coffee, but during the Summer I often turn to soft drinks instead (I usually do not want a hot drink when it is 100 degrees outside).  I was not sure what to expect from this, but was surprised that it was quite delicious and refreshing!  Being a Cappuccino, it has low fat milk (which is nice, since most places just use whole milk), and a hint of cocoa (not too much where you cannot taste the coffee, but there is a hint that makes it perfect)!  Because of the low fat milk and cocoa this beverage has 100 calories, 1.5g of Fat (1g Sat Fat), 19g of Carbs, and 18g of Sugar (from label).  That is not too bad considering what some coffee beverages have.  The coffee is very strong and has a great taste, it is not bitter and drinks very smoothly.  When I got this item, I placed it in the fridge and it was in there fore a few days (so it was nice and cold), and it was very refreshing and smooth, the coffee was the primary taste in the drink, and the milk and cocoa were secondary, so you got a nice taste of what tasted like high quality coffee with a smooth finish from the milk and cocoa.  I am very pleased with this drink and found it quite refreshing and a nice change from a standard cup of coffee (especially during these hot days), and with only 100 calories it is a great start to the day!  Highly recommend!!!",coffee
This Vanilla Biscotti flavor is one of my favorite coffees. Great flavor. Is truly the epitome of curling up with a good book by the fire kind of coffee. Folgers does a great job on their Gourment coffees.,coffee
"I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!",coffee
I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.,tea

"Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more.",tea
"This is by far the best tea I have ever had to drink.  I purchased my first cup at a Barnes and Nobles and could not wait to get home to find the tea on the internet and order.  Try it, if you like cinnamon you will love this tea.  Great hot or cold.",tea
"I am not a coffee drinker, but tea is what wakes me up in the morning. This is a great black tea, with a wonderful flavor.  I french press it to bring out the flavor, this loose leaf tea is perfect for this.  I have never enjoyed a cup of tea more than this one.",tea
"If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product.",tea
"The product is so versatile and flavorful. I use it to make instant ginger tea, also to cook Asian style dishes or bake delicious cookies. I trust Frontier, they always carry high quality products, non irradiated and sulfur-free.",tea

"Not only is this a great deal, but the pineapple is delicious. Emerald does a great job, and each piece looks great and is nice and juicy.  I would just warn people to be aware of the sugar content, because there is 20g per serving.",flavored drinks
"I use this every morning for the protein. Low calorie, lots of protein and I love the coffee flavor. Not a fan of the hot, but I throw it in my Magic Bullet with ice and water. Frozen and delicious.",flavored drinks
I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking.,flavored drinks
"I would like to share with you who are contemplating Mr. Trivedi's products, I was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux. I was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no,s.  About 3 months ago I found out about this incredible water, since then that is all I drink.  I had the most amazing results, not only easing my acid reflux,but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which I am not especially noted for.  At the 11-11-11 retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in Soho, she remarked how different and calmer I was compared to 2 months ago. I know there will always be skeptics, I am ready for them.  Thank you, Mr. Trivedi",flavored drinks
"I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.  The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!  Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.",flavored drinks
"I drink Crystal Light like it was ...water!  This is a good flavor when you want to break out of the ordinary berry/orange/grape, etc.  It is not too tart like lemonade can be nor too bitter as pomegrante can be.  I do not drink this flavor every day but it is a nice change from my regular flavors!",flavored drinks
"Ugh....I tried this as a replacement for the Coconut Water with Pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program.  This stuff is awful.  It's got added sugar, which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross.  Never getting this stuff again.  (And I do love coconut water, in general, as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than Gatorade...well, usually.  Not this stuff.)",flavored drinks

These taste fantastic!! And Amazon sells them for a less expensive price than my local health food store! Thank you Amazon!,cat_dog_baby
I can't believe anyone is buying this stuff at Amazon!!!  Go to Keurig.com and pay half of this price.  Spread the word because this is rediculous!,cat_dog_baby
With the economy so tight I feel fortunate to have found the cat food my cats like for a price I can afford.  Thanks!,cat_dog_baby
I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging!,cat_dog_baby

"Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great. Good healthy snack without giving up the taste. So glad I discovered these! Salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 cal/bag, 3.5g fat/bag",chips
"These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right ""kick"",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.  Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price.",chips
"We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!",chips
"I needed these for my toddler granddaughter who has allergies to dairy, egg, and peanuts.  This product is free from all that worry.  The chips are small, love that, b/c I even use this in my cannoli filling and can pipe it out of a star-tip pastry bag w/o clogging up the works. They taste absolutely identical to any other chocolate chip, not 'off' tasting. In the health-food stores, this is about $5 a bag.  At this price I can bake with it and use more w/o worry of being a spendthrift. I made allergy-safe chocolate chip cookies with these yesterday and I had to stop myself from eating them all...a great product.",chips
What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers.,chips

"I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless.",grocery
"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""  Boo on Betty Crocker.",grocery

"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).  While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.  While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.  Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.  If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.",grocery
"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans.",grocery
Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months,snacks

"I purchased these bars as a meal replacement after a job during lunch.  The texture is a bit hard (moat if not all protein bars are hard) but these Special K Protein Bars tastes great!  With 10 grams of protein per bar, it is a much better alternative then other snacks out there.  I only have other protein bars that I use as meal replacements after a workout or job and these Special K bars tastes the best to me.  I will be buying more!",snacks

"I used to be allergic to peanuts as a child, and I have a strong taste aversion to peanuts and peanut butter, but I love almond butter. After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds.",snacks
"I am by no means a granola connoisseur, but this stuff is pretty darn tasty.  This product is made with all natural ingredients. There honestly isn't a lot of chocolate in it -- just the right amount. It's dark chocolate but isn't too bitter or too sweet. Overall it's just a very nice blend and tastes delicious. Maybe a little pricey, but not a dealbreaker when considering it's made with real ingredients. I'd say 5/5 for taste, 3/5 for value. Recommended.",chocolate_milk
"These are some awfully tasty donuts.  They consist of a fairly dense golden cake coated in chocolate.  They're small, but rather dense and rich.  They're always moist- probably because of some additive, but it's the additives that make them tasty.

"I stumbled upon these cookies while shopping at Target and instantly fell in love with their amazing chocolate taste, not to mention their healthy ingredients.

"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:  INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)  Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.  So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?  Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.  I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.  In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.

EDITED TO ADD: I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before.

"I have long haired dachshunds which like to dig out.  In the beginning the fido 525cs worked but was not powerful as it would not shock through the long haired coat of my dachshunds. They had to hit it with the face or shorter haired (skin exposed) underbelly areas in order to get a good reaction on them. I had the fido 525cs set up for maybe 2 months before it stopped working completely and the dogs were back to getting out again.  No, it did not get wet as my husband built a wood box for the charger ""house"" of protection.  It just stopped working and by that time I had thrown away my receipt which was from a small garden center on an old type register so that it didn't list the product name anyway.  Thus no warranty proof nor refund available.  I am looking for a better quality charger which will hit harder through the long haired coat.
