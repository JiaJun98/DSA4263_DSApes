"Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just can't get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so I'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it's bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*that's been pissed on in the woods).",breakfast drinks
"Biryani when done as per instructed comes out really good and authentic! I dont like their other products, but highly recommend this for any Indian food lover. Total preparation time is around 1 hour, but its really worth it",breakfast drinks
I don't like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss.,breakfast drinks
"My daughter and I love the taste of Big Train Vanilla Chai, it isn't too spicy like other Chai's can be.",breakfast drinks
I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.,breakfast drinks
"I bought this tea to try something new (I was tired of ordinary bergamote teas), and now I've ordered it again. Great taste, nice can.",breakfast drinks
My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.,breakfast drinks
I bought this because of the antioxidants will keep it for the taste. Tastes like Arabica without being overwhelming. Its the best of both worlds when you can have a product that is good for you and tastes great too.,breakfast drinks

"I purchase Banh Trang Spring Rolls Skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls, but recently I got a container with black spots mixed into the skin.  I tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didn't work and had to be thrown away.  At the bottom of the container, 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin.  At that point, I decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until I purchased a fresh batch of a different brand..  When trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly, I was unable locate their company webpage, although there were many references to the Co. name Bahn Trang.",service
"I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.  It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!",service
This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One may purchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz. The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar and forget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to  help me when confronted with the facts so poor customer service.,service
"It was a great gift! The recipient loved it. He was happy and if he's happy, so am I. I would definitely do business w/ these folks again.",service

"This is very good maple syrup, but like most pure maple syrup, it is very expensive. My husband and I duped ourselves when purchasing this product. We did the math wrong, and though that we were paying about $25 for a half gallon rather than only 32 oz.  Man was I surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail!",dessert
Somehow I thought for the price - I was getting a case - not one little bag.  Should have ordered the case I found elsewhere.,dessert
Just a little pricy but worth having.  Made from corn much better than the rice  If you haven t tried this I would strongly suggest you give it a  try and by buying it 12 at a time it also saves you money,dessert
I ordered this for my diabetic daughter.  I found some not so great reviews from people  so I only ordered one bottle.  My whole family loves this stuff!!!  I even like it and I am not a sno-cone fan.  It has an excellent flavor!  The syrup is light and doesnt overtake the ice.  I will order all of my syrups from Back to Basics sugar free collection from now on.  I highly reccoment this product!!!!,dessert
"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!",dessert

"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again.",flavoured drinks_carbohydrates
"We ordered the Earth's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.

This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed.,flavoured drinks_carbohydrates
A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.,flavoured drinks_carbohydrates
I don't know if it gives me any more energy but it has a surprisingly natural flavor with very little (if any) after taste for a no calorie beverage.  You can really taste the blueberry.,flavoured drinks_carbohydrates
"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acaia, Natural Flavors and colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Soy. I was very surprised that this taste like a great Tangerine soda. Each can has 140 calories, 1orNo thanks I am  swimming from 15 mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 34g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C and 20 % of Vitamin A.  I would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange/Tangerine flavored juice again. I found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink. But for my money I would rather by the  IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)  brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories.",flavoured drinks_carbohydrates
"I grew up in an Italian household and this was the only pasta my father would cook with. It was always available in the grocery store on the east coast when I lived there. I rarely see it where I live now in the mid west. When I do it is outrageously priced and a very limited selection.  I love this pasta and ordering it online is cheaper and easier than going out to the store. I also use subscribe and save which reduces the price even more and there is no shipping cost. It is a staple in our house.  The quality is excellent.  Cooked as directed the pasta holds its form and texture.  It doesn't become mushy or fall apart.  Even if you like your pasta soft and not ""Al Dente"" it holds in shape.",flavoured drinks_carbohydrates

"My son was nursed, and then we found out he was allergic to Cow's Milk.  I couldn't get him to drink any other milk alternative. He loves this product!  My only complaint is that it doesn't come in single serve sizes, so when we  travel, I am constantly carrying around the big container in a cooler. For day trips in the car this is fine, but this stinks for airplane travel.  I have tried to serve him the single serve of rice milk, but he simply will not drink as much as this.  He loves it!",snacks_dairy
Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.,snacks_dairy
"FantasiCakes sent my cake FAST, and it was also sent MOIST!!  For me it's hard to go wrong with chocolate, but this cake really is fantastic! The icing comes on the side so you can warm it up and drizzle it on at your leisure. I really liked that because I don't normally like a lot of icing. LOVE IT!",snacks_dairy
"For a great appetizer, stuff these little guys with goat cheese (or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese) and a little fresh basil.  Just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie, sqish to mix (add mild if too thick), cut a corner from the bag, and squeeze into the drained Peppadews.  They'll be the hit of the dinner party.  For style points, serve in a long skinny olive dish.",snacks_dairy
"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme. Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting. Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.  In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky.",snacks_dairy
"I was surprised to finally see vegan baked goods on Amazon. I normally bake my own vegan baked goods but am always looking for products to try or send to my daughters in college. Because I do bake when I have time, I'm pretty picky and I have make pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, muffins, and carrot cake. Marge's  breads were outstanding! They were moist and not overly sweet. The icing on the carrot cake was delicious. They arrived in a couple of days as promised in a cute little basket which I'm using elsewhere now. I did freeze them as soon as they arrived and they held up beautifully. Since my order, I went directly to their website to order just the carrot cake. I wish Amazon would allow the option of only ordering three of the same breads. Thank you Marge's Bakery for making an outstanding product...thank you Amazon for finally carrying some vegan products--please continue to find these small businesses throughout our country!",snacks_dairy
"This is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great.  My German Shepard, like the others, has horrible food allergies.  I tried the Royal Canine Venison which was OK but when I tried this, my dog, who is never that excited about food, went crazy.  He loves the taste, his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier.  Yes it is expensive, but worth it!",dog_cat

"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again.",dog_cat
"I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE.",dog_cat
"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words ""temptations"" and ""vomit"" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible)).",dog_cat
"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one.",dog_cat
"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]",dog_cat
"I had bought this product last year my dog loved them, but... I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China.",dog_cat
"Instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans, I received a cardboard box, with a plastic bag full of jelly beans.  They were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag.  On the box there was a typed label that said:""green apple jelly  belly 16 oz. new"".  There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience.",family_sweet snacks

"Most of the reviews are mostly negative, but if your brand new to this candy......its sooo delicious! If you like a chewy, hardness..feeling like your jaw is going to fall off. This is the stuff! I'm 16 and never heard of this candy before, but i tried it once at a world market and couldn't stop eating them, there so addicting! They have a great mouth watering taste to them. I would recommend this candy to new comers.",family_sweet snacks

"These lollipops are a wonderfully healthy option over regular store brand suckers/lollipops.  My children and I are very happy with the taste of these.  The flavors we have tried so far are tasty and strong, and the size is perfect for a special treat.  The 5 pound bag should last us a very long time.",family_sweet snacks

They came during a heat wave so some of them melted. However that's not the issue. They tasted burnt and just not that good. The ones at Trader Joe's are soo much better.,coffee
"This time, forget ordering through Amazon.  You can get the same product, 24 K-Cups for $12.75 at Big Cat or for $14.80 at Keurig.  These prices are a rip off.",coffee
I've been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon.,coffee
Ordered these after receiving my new k-cup machine.  Taste great after finding the correct serving size.  Quick service and good price.  Definitely ordering more!,coffee
"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee.",coffee
I am happy with my purchase. The mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them (not old and dusty in other words).,coffee
"The hot chocolate has a great taste. I purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed. The kids had no idea it was sugar free. Even the adults we gave it to had no clue. Like other reviewers said - it doesn't mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up. If you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water, stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted. On a positive note, each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!",coffee
"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!",coffee
This product is easy to make and has a great taste.  I just wish it was gluten free.  A simple change in the soy sauce used would make it that way just like the General Tsao's Chicken by the same company.,sauce_condiments
I love this product. Delivered on time and taste great. I use a lot of butter in my cooking and this large size is perfect. All the tasted without the bad stuff.,sauce_condiments
"This sauce tastes pretty good! It's creamy, spicy (but not overly so), and has a nice flavor that pairs well with burritos and other Mexican-style foods. That said, I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is. The bottle is quite small. 8 fluid ounces is the two-thirds the size of a soda can, so the amount of sauce you get really isn't very much at all. They make the bottle wide and skinny so that it has the appearance of capacity. The concave curves on the side further deceive the eye. So in summary, what we have here is a tasty sauce offered for a high price. I would recommend perhaps looking for a single bottle at your local supermarket before committing to an entire six-pack, to see if the flavor is worth the cost for you.",sauce_condiments
The whole family (even those who are not GF) loves the flavor of this mac & cheese.  Tastes like the Kraft velveeta cheese & shells. We made the recipe on the box which was yummy.,sauce_condiments
We cannot believe how flavorful this Kraft Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce tastes.  I used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped!  It's not too spicy for us and I assume it's because of the brown sugar.  You can't go wrong with buying a product from Kraft Foods.,sauce_condiments
"Had the pleasure of trying Outerbridge's Sherry Pepper Sauce in a fish chowder.  Delicious. Have since used it for stews and other soups, and as a marinade.  Adds just the right amount of kick, with loads of flavor.  Their steak sauce and soy sauce are also devine. A little flavor of the island right here in my house.",sauce_condiments
Seriously I didn't taste it but my dogs love these.  Shipping was very fast... I received them within 2 or 3 days of ordering.  Good price.,sauce_condiments
I didn't look closely enough at the price.  I thought sold in 10 packs meant 10 packages.  When I received 10 little marshmallows for $10 + $4.95 shipping and handling I was floored.  I have made homemade marshmallows and the contents don't cost very much.,sauce_condiments

I was hugely disappointed with this product. The Walden Farms line of 0 calorie salad dressings are great. This alfredo sauce is not. Do not waste your money on it!,snack_chips
I love these!  I found these initially at Sam's and then they discontinued selling them.  I was so glad when I found them on Amazon.  They are such a healthy and tasteful snack! They really taste good and my son and daughter-in-law have started eating them and love them too!,snack_chips
Bought this because our new son-in-law loves it and they could not find it in stores anywhere. He was thrilled.,snack_chips
"These chips make a wonderful snack.  They give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times, without a lot of calories.  They also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time.  They came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control.  I would order them again.",snack_chips
"These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.

"My son is on a Gluten Free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category, and that taste good enough for him to eat...is very hard.  He loves these bars.  He thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could. They are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that.  These bars are on average, pretty expensive in the stores, but I can purchase them off Amazon for much cheaper and I usually buy them in bulk. If you have a picky eater, or if anyone is on a specific diet, these might be something to consider.  As many know, it is hard to find Gluten free snack products that taste very similiar to regular ones and these really do make the cut.

Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.,calories_protein_snack_bar

"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.  This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.  FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.",calories_protein_snack_bar
Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good,calories_protein_snack_bar
"These treats were surprisingly tasty and filling.  140 calories per serving (3 cookies).  But the cookies were really the perfect size for a light snack.

"With both a stomach problem and a love of coffee, I thought this would be a great solution. I was wrong. I just didn't care for the taste. I recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a 10-pack of bags for home brew. :(",coffee_drinks

"I started Taster's Choice from Original Gourmet. After I bought French Roast, I found it labeled ""darker"" than the one I was drinking. I am afraid that it will be too strong. After I tasted it, I am so glad that it is the right taste for me. It is so convenient. I love it and highly recoment it!",coffee_drinks
"The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.  I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.",coffee_drinks
The best product yet for Tassimo.  I only wish it made a larger cup of coffee.,coffee_drinks
"This is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable.  The grind is finer than what is normal for auto-drip makers, which is good because I can use less so it goes much further, making it even more economical.  I have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again.",coffee_drinks
"I've had many different types of Starbucks coffee and there are very few I don't like. I don't really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it. I usually prefer a dark bold brew like French but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint. It has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change. The smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews.  It's made with Latin American beans and has natural ingredients. Bring the empty bag to Starbucks when you're done and you'll get a free coffee.  Overall, the taste/quality i'll give 4 stars.",coffee_drinks
This stuff is great to make egg dishes special.  It does add a truffle scent but you must cut down on adding other salt.,grocery
This Nori is a true bargain! 10 sheets of Nori at local grocery stores ran for as much as 1$ per sheet. 50 sheets at less than $10 is hard to beat. Really glad I got this as I am now making sushi several times a week!,grocery
"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)  Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!",grocery
"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market.",grocery
"I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.  Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.  Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.",grocery
The stuff is great but I'll pay at most $4 or $5 for four bottles.,grocery
"I bought this product due to my obsession with Malai Kofta, and also the high reviews.  I was not disappointed.  There is great flavor in the product and it filled me up for dinner.  The potato dumpling/balls were a little hard but I had boiled the pouch, so maybe next time I will pour the whole packet out and heat it up that way.  Highly recommended, it is the next best thing when you are too lazy to head to the Indian restaurant 20 miles away!",grocery
This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you can't do it in a midrowave.,grocery
I bought my first RJ's soft licorice log today and it is absolutely the best black licorice I have ever tasted!!,crackers_snacks
"My son loves these snacks for lunch or car rides. I used to buy them at the grocery store in the organic section, but it's less expensive and more convenient to order them through Subscribe and Save. I have tried them as well and they are quite yummy.",crackers_snacks
If you like spicy...then these are the snack crackers for you. So hard to find ANYWHERE ELSE...a really good price on here!,crackers_snacks
"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame.",crackers_snacks
"I really like these crackers and I'm thrilled that Amazon offers this product. I'm a Bariatric patient and it's always hard to find a crunchy treat that is healthy.  I save a ton of money too because buying individual boxes was getting quite pricey for me since I eat at least 2 crackers each day.  I've tried all 3 flavors that Amazon offers; they all are quite tasty, but this one is my all-time favorite.",crackers_snacks
"It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much.",crackers_snacks
I sent this case of soup to my son. Great deal and I know he has food for now,crackers_snacks
These are my favourite flavour of rice crackers.  They are especially great with hummus!,crackers_snacks
