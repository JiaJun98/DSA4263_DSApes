Current topic: breakfast_tea

Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea.

I really like the Cappucino flavor of this soy milk and drink it daily at breakfast. I've given it a 5-star rating, but find that it is much too pricey from Amazon. I will continue to purchase it at my local market for less than $3 a carton.

Very fast shipping. I made Hot and Sour soup with these. Re-hydrated these increase in volume almost 4 times. You have to have these to make authentic Hot and Sour soup. They add a nice crunch and have very good health benefits. Will definitely order again.

I am completely hooked on Lipton's glass size cold brew tea bags. The small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags.  Thank you Lipton!

Excellent price, considering what the local coffe shop charges for chai. This is the best chai tea mix I've ever tasted and the best value I've found.

Every year for the holidays I buy my brother a pack of these chai tea packets for him to use at university. he loves them!

I think these are delicious. They taste like chocolate and are not too sweet. My boys love them with a cold glass of milk. We ordered them about a couple of months ago, and still have some, so you get plenty for your money. I would recommend them to a friend, and I'm planning on trying the cinnamon ones, too.

Like the chocolate, hard to find the other flavor, don't know why but no one carries it.

Current topic: coffee

I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both.

I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.

Disclaimer: I'm a coffee addict.  I'm also a Starbucks addict, so I've become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and can't stand the economy stuff.  I've had regular Melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it, so I decided to give the decaf version a try. Especially when the weather gets cold, I like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later.  The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.  While I continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions, I'm glad to know there's a good, flavorful substitute for when I don't want caffeine.

Tasted bland - did not have the freshness and aroma of sping onions - Would not buy again

I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. I finally ask myself why am I eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don't seem to like it much either.

To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.  For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.  My favorite k-cups are: Starbucks French Roast Starbucks Caffe Verona Starbucks Pike Place Roast Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Green Mountain Revv Green Mountain Dark Magic  Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold

Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture. Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.

I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon.

Exactly how I expected, but more gel than paste. Actually, no paste at all, just gel.  Like Vanilla Bean extract, but without the alcohol bit.  Great.

You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.  Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better.

I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).  I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.  So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had.

I discovered this at my local grocery store and loved it.  Went looking for it cheaper and found it here.  Was shocked by the 2 poor reviews.  Come on - you chose a very healthy whole wheat gnocchi, with a very minimal ingredient/additive list.  Did you think it would taste as "good" as the versions loaded with white flour, sugar and oils?  The product cooks very easily and absorbs the delicious flavors of whatever sauce I put over it.

I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it.....

"GREAT taste". Great taste, dissolves well, etc. Highly recommend. I can sometimes buy at Kroger. I usually add to more wter than recommended. THANKS Hansen!

These are great cacao nibs!  Wonderful in recipes!  I even substituted them for chocolate chips in  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread recipe I had.  It turned out very good!  These are also great chopped up in the food processor & used in raw food snacks.  I did have a problem with my first shipment from Amazon, one of the bags burst open due to their poor packing.  BUT Amazon sent me a new shipment for free so no complaints there!  Organic Pure Raw Cacao Nibs enjoyment the healthy way!

i get these all the time and this seller has a good price, best on the web so far. and just the rite size too, not too big and there hard all the way through. iv had some the crumbled about 2/3 through.

There isn't a whole lot that is special about Stride Gum. I kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time. It doesn't really freshen your breath and you don't get the "clean" feeling of other gums. It doesn't really last that long either so I wasn't too fond of it. Either way if your a fan of Stride go for it.

Very disappointed in the taste ... nothing like it is described. Tastes very watery with some sugar added to it. Bummed I wasted my $$$.

I drink a gallon a day.  This is better than regular sugar kool aid and so much cheaper on amazon.  I order regularly

I often buy products like this to use when traveling, because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road.  This tasted like fresh-brewed tea and disolved completely.  I wasn't stuck with a residue on the bottom.  Just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor.

The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...  And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. It's not like we we're searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:  Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. "Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish."  I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. "Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish."  We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...  BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up.

Quality fruit, great texture not a brick! on the top of my reorder list! Highly recommend to all who love a lite fruit cake

I usually drink the regular Caffe D"Vita but I am on a low carb diet with no sugar so I thought I would try the sugar free. I couldn't find it in the stores so I bought a six pack can through the internet. It has absolutly no taste. Now I am stuck with six cans of sugar free Caffe D" Vita and don't know what to do with them. I would not buy this product again.

What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?  I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.  For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.  For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.  In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: "natural" cane juice, fruit juices, "raw" sugar, "organic" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.  So, what's in this stuff?

Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste.

I received a sample from Influenster and I have to say these are my new favorite breakfast bar. I LOVE banana nut bread and these have that same flavor. Great for on the go and they are healthy for you too. I keep one in my purse in case I ever need a quick snack. Definitely recommend these!

Tried this and the Chicken, neither left a pleasant taste at all. They were bitter and just not good for a soup base.

I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in "160ml of water" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.

Thank you King Arthur for this wonderful mix!!! I enjoy baking, however after being diagnosed with Celiac disease last year, it kind of took the fun out of baking for me. But with this mix...the baker is BACK! ;-) These cookies are exceptional!!! My gluten consuming friends couldn't tell the difference!! Can't wait to try the other products!! Please keep developing more new gluten free mixes!

I like these sausages better than other products from this company.  Yes, they are a little expensive but worth it.  I'v tried them boiled, fried and grilled with excellent result -- highly recommended.  Check for specials for free shipping since it saves about 20% off the total price.

Good quality Rose Petal Powder at a very good price!  I'm using it as a face and body scrub, as well as a mask.  It can be used alone, or it mixes well into argan oil or any liquid soaps and lotions.  Also highly recommend the vendor; the shipment was exactly as ordered and arrived in a reasonable time.

Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.  I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.

these are very pricey so i only enjoy them now and then as a treat but the flavor is wonderfull and the packaging is very nice. would make a wonderfull gift to send to someone who likes such dainties. i will order again when i run out, truly a nice treat.

I buy these locally, and they are more expensive than Amazon.com. My dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth. Thanks.

This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!

Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this brand! I tried another and they refused to eat them! If you love your pups and treat them like children-BUY THESE! Mine are not too spolied - DIVA and TIFFANY! They get them every holiday and I am never without a supply on hand. Try greenies too!

Do not buy this product.  You will not be doing your infant any favors.  If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding.  (I know it's not always easy or convenient.)  If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then "fortify" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the "green" movement.  OH and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar!!! Good way to start the diabetes/obesity while they're young!

If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would.  There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder.  This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.

For a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water.,,,nothing can beat Dr. McDougall's Split Pea Soup with Barley. This is the best "instant soup" that is on the market.

We've had this spice blend since picking it up at a Whole Foods in Portland after tasting a sample.  Company was coming over and we needed something easy that could be prepped ahead.  Enter the Moroccan Spice Blend, and it received rave reviews.  We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for about a day and a half.  When it came time to cook, we just dumped them into a 9x13 dish and baked as directed for an hour.  Serving it with couscous, Moroccan carrot salad, and coconut cupcakes, we spent the rest of the evening thoroughly stuffed.  Absolutely delicious!  Sweet and savory, the blend had just the right amount of kick without setting our mouths on fire.  Fabulous!

I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine.

Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets.

I just got my first case and let it get cold in the fridge for a couple days.  Drank my first bottle tonight and let me tell you, it tastes like.....WATER!  I didn't detect any dirty taste or even an aftertaste.  I don't understand what people are saying it tastes funky because all I drink is water and milk.  This tastes like my bottled regular water.  I'm going to switch to 2-3 bottles of BLK Water a day and see if it really makes me feel any better and energized.

I have been taking this for many years and love it.  The taste isn't bad at all, though, if you are used to having your Protein Drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener, you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a McDonald's Milk Shake.  But the taste is fine.  It is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product, as in addition to 26 grams of vegan protein, it is loaded with other healthful nutrients.  Each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it, plus a vitamin complex, and enzymes.  If you are looking for a really excellent Vegan Protein this is the ticket, plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi-vitamin.

These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative.

My daughter is so limited in what she can eat( no sugar, wheat, grains, dairy, etc.) and this is one sweet that she can have and not get ill. The plus side is they taste great and the price was pretty good too!

These gummi vitamins taste great - -sweet and sour. Made with arctic cloudberries, which are like yellow raspberries but not as sweet. Suitable for adults as well as kids.

These are great snacks for my kids and my teenagers even like them.  Better for them than high preservative and/or high calorie snacks and they give them some good carbs and protein.

I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K-cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K-cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.

Same thing I buy in the grocery store, but 1/3 cheaper and I didn't have to use my expensive gas to go get it.

I have this on autoship.  Maple syrup is sooo expensive in the grocery store and you only get a small bottle.  I have a family of 5!  I love the autoship and you can't beat the price! Tastes great too!

This is a good price and my very picky son eats this. Tt was delivered on time and i used the amazon subscription to get the price a little lower.

I bought this for my hubby, he loves dark rich coffee & Dark Magic offers it. Great convenience of the Kcup makes it that much nicer.

This product is great for people on who eat plant-based, whole foods.  There is no sugar added.  The product tastes delicious.  The price, however, is quite expensive for the size of the jar.  I found a similar product at a local whole-foods grocery store for half the price.

This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry.

I want to say this coffee is very good .Have had no issues with bad pods .Check your machine if you are having issues with pod breaking open .Sometimes the  needle get clongged or worn and you will start having this issue.I love the price of this coffee.Great taste you will see the price of kerig pods come down soon the patent has expired

I've just gone through my first box of this beef jerky, and it tastes really good.  My whole family likes it.  It's spicy, but not unbearable.  The sweetness tend to balance out the spiciness.  The only problem I had with my first order was that one of the bags was moldy.  Must be faulty packaging.

A terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds.  We only got pieces of pork skin

Despite the poor review below, this instant Udon Bowl is suprisingly delicious.  This instant udon bowl is so delicious, most people can't tell the difference between Udon served at a restaurant, and the Udon from this bowl.  I love adding an egg to my meal with this udon, I just plop it in there, with bowling water, and boom.  Fresh Udon with egg.  Can't be beat. Enjoy!

The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min.  The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll.  The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great.  I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice.  Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack.  The calorie count is 340.  But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch.  I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10.  It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price.  Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration.

I had a recipe for a pear-pomegranate pie which required this ingredient. I also used it in a blood orange, pomegranate, fennel, shallot, beet, feta cheese and toasted almond salad. I served both of these with a crown roast of pork with Cumberland sauce for Christmas dinner. This molasses is sour and sweet simultaneously and imparts an interesting taste but could, if used too lavishly, overhwhelm a dish.

This item is way over priced.  Check your local walmart and find it way cheaper!  The juice is great tasting with kids!

I bought this on a walmart and then decided to buy it on line. the smokey taste not overpowering the rest of the food makes it perfect. I don't like much spicy food and this has just the right amount of spicyness. the oaky flavor is a plus too.

I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable).

My kids loves Chips Ahoy! and I will have them once in a while as well.  But the kids refuse to eat them from this Family Size package.  Once I tasted them, I knew why.  They have an awful medicinal taste.  Really bad.  I don't what the problem is, but if you like Chips Ahoy, you will not like these.  Go elsewhere.

one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone. If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...

Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!

Looking for a delicious crunchy snack that won't go straight to your waistline? These paper thin - beautifully seasoned crackers hold up perfectly on their own and to any/all of your favorite toppings. Hummus, cheese (hard and spreadable), vegetable wafers (cucumbers, zucchini, roasted peppers etc), chip dips, salsa... I could go on forever. At 120 calories for 19 crackers (0 calories from fat) these wonderful wafers will satisfy any snack attack and you'll feel great about eating them. I initially found these in a "Health Food Store" but Amazon sells and ships them for cheaper money. Quality was as good or better. Well... that's what I think. Oh, and YUM!

Somersaults are a terrific snack...addictive really.  Healthier than most snacks and very convenient packaging.  Be warned you will want more.

BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER

I've enjoyed this product for several years, and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon. Thank you.

I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER TUSCAN 3 CHEESE N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS  THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.  I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
