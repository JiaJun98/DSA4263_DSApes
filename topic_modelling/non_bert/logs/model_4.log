Current topic: coffee

Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...

This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.  So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!  This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.

This coffee looks like its a collection of beans which has been swept up off the floor afer a days roasting...WHICH IS NOT MEANT AS A CRITICISM...thats what I would expect poor mans blend to be...but seriously, its very consistently decent coffee...you can't beat it for the subscription price...i think I am on my 3rd bag (5#'s!) and am hooked. There are certainly better coffees but not for the "Poor Man" (me).

Taste was average and I would not buy it again.  Since taste is personal, others may like it better.

This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.

I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve

Several of the seller's listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing. As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed.

This coffee . Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)  is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee.

Current topic: tea

I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea.

This is the best K-cup tea I've found so far. It tastes very good and doesn't use the word "exotic" to add random spices that are not necessary. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful.

I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended.

If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.  In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.  Have always used loose tea, but this time wanted to try their teabags (because of the convenience/portability) and to see if the bagged tea would brew as clear as the loose tea, and I am happy to report that it actually does.  I am so glad to find Ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current Prime deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally). I'm taking advantage of the Subscribe and Save offer.  The six tea boxes arrived nicely packed (see the photos I uploaded).  Each box has a packing date (08/2011) and a best before date (08/2014).  This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.

I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.

I'm a chinese student. It smells like fruit, but it doesn't have ANY taste when you take a sip. Doesn't taste a little bit like TEA.

This is the best black tea I've ever had that came out of a teabag.  It has a distinct and rich tangy flavor that is almost reminiscent of an expensive bourbon.  Most other brands seem highly unsatisfactory after getting used to this delicious tea, so I plan to keep some around all the time.  It's a little expensive but nowhere near as expensive as going to a cafe or tea house to get a great cup of tea.

The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; it's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee. I had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning I could feel relief of pressure and pain. I would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent. As a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown.

Current topic: flavored drinks

The muffiins had absolutely no taste.  I added some extra sweetener and some ginger and cinnamon and they tasted much better.

I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.  Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.  I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.  So this product is all the good things rolled into one:  100% fruit juice No added sugar Bubbly Awesome orange flavor  It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy.

This brand of energy drink tastes good and really gives you a jolt of energy.  I didn't have jitters afterwards and I noticed a difference in focus.  I have problems with some of them making me jittery but this one really worked with no side effects.

I have tried a few other wheat grass powders and had a hard time drinking them. This was very mild. I can drink it just mixed with water. My 2 year old and 4 year old liked it and wanted more. I love all of the Amazing Grass products. They all taste great and are a great company to order from.

The Switch is marketed as "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't"...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors ("natural" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.  The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.  The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill.

I really like Halter bonbons.  They have a genuine fruit taste and are not icky sweet like some sugar free candy.  Cherry, strawberry, and orange are my favorites.  I do wish they came individually wrapped.  They are often hard to find and somewhat pricey, but in my view they are worth it.

Not much to say. I grew up on this stuff and it is very good.

I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).  I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.  So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had.

Used this last night and we had great tasting spaghetti.  Packaging was good and it came in a reasonable time.  Good job.

I had been looking for a healthier breakfast. This has worked great for me. I can add a variety of food items to this to add variety. I prepare a large quantity in a rice cooker and store it in the refrigerator. When it is time to eat, an amount can be dished up and various ingredients can be added. Chopped walnuts, blue berries, honey, cinamon, brown sugar, etc. Not all at once. Milk is added and then re-heated in the microwave. I think it makes a great healthy breakfast or any time meal.

[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago.  I was very disappointed with the quality.  I was unable to eat these sardines.  They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture.  Sorry product.  I'm giving them to the cats.  B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]

Very fresh tasting and refreshing. Better than any other brand I have tried. A good buy if you get it delivered on a regular basis. Short reviews not wanted by Amazon.

This product is fantastic.  I have had Creme Brulee many times in France and this is just the same! I would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it.

For a serving of full flavored and nutritious split pea soap that involves only boiling and pouring water.,,,nothing can beat Dr. McDougall's Split Pea Soup with Barley. This is the best "instant soup" that is on the market.

I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!

This is an excellent product and a good price...I have been using coconut oil in most of my cooking now...

Current topic: chips

For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures.

I love this product. The taste is great and it is very easy to prepare. My family loves this product.

I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!

I purchased these cracker chips at Walmart twice and now I can't find them and they have no idea what I am talking about.  Love them and have some coupons, but can't find them now.  I will continure to look.  Trying to be healthy and these are great.

If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have "just a touch."

This was a very pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant when I read through the ingredients. Sure, it sounded healthy, but would it taste good?  In a word, outstanding! Good crunch, flavor and just the right amount of salt. Great to see that there's snack foods available that are a lot better for you than the usual chips and nachos.  The only problem is that everyone likes them, so they disappear quickly!

I order this for my office and everyone loves it. I think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such.

I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.  I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.

I ordered this as pumpkin seems to be in very short supply this year.  I was unable to find it at any of my three local grocery stores.  The quality of this is excellent.

I started using Swiss Miss Diet a few months ago and love it for on;y 25 calories. The price on Amazon far exceeds any grocery store in my area.

The stores around here do not carry this product.  My husband is diabetic and Swiss Miss No Sugar is perfect for us.  We use it with coffee to make our own cafe mochas.

For an all natural diet drink, this is amazing. It has a better taste then most other Rootbeers that are found in stores and is better for you! I originally didn't realize this was diet when I bought it, but I don't mind at all! It is actually much better in my opinion then the non-diet version, but its up to you!  Note: This is really only a good deal if you get free shipping through Amazon Prime, because when these are on sale in stores, they cost about the same (give or take $1-$3)

Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon.

I was very pleased with the price of this product. And the shipping speed was fast! I like that I didn't have to lug this back from the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon!

Great item and great service. This gum is really hard to find in my area and it's a favorite of ours. We've ordered this a couple of times and I order this as soon as I run out and I'm always pleased.  Thanks

cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!

I received a sample from Influenster and I have to say these are my new favorite breakfast bar. I LOVE banana nut bread and these have that same flavor. Great for on the go and they are healthy for you too. I keep one in my purse in case I ever need a quick snack. Definitely recommend these!

These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative.

Even with the chocolate chunks, these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and I really appreciated that.  They have 110 calories each and 8 grams sugar which is less than Kudos Chocolate Chip (120 cal, 12 sugar) or a Cascadian Farms Chocolate Chip granola bar (140 cal, 10 sugar).  When I need a quick snack, I can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and I feel full until the next meal.  If I need a quick meal I eat one of these with two string cheeses, a large apple and water -- I can make it until dinner.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack.

So far have tried two flavors, this and oat & raisins and prefer the other better. This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.  As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.  I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars.

We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a "normal" cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights.

These things are great.  They never freeze solid, they're always slushly.  And each one is only 60 calories.

At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not; it actually makes them good and not disgusting like some other granola type bars. I'm torn between the apple pie ones and these which are both the same price. One of each makes a good cheap lunch @ $1.60.

This Organic protein bar tastes great.  My cousins told me about the organic dark almond chocolate bar.  This one is good too.

These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best-known name brand of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand. This is a plus!  They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.  Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie.  I love `em! Enjoy!

Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste.

I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.

Nice for break fast. No bloated tummy,applely flavor.Enjoyed several breakfastes with the pan cakes. Good taste and texture.Yummy for kids too.

These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!).

We decided to try our hand at snow cone making this summer since the money we spent last year at our local stand could have bought a small house!  This was our first purchase of syrup, and we are so pleased with the quality.  It tastes exactly the same as what we have enjoyed in the past.  The banana is delish, and my kids have loved every flavor we have tried thus far!  Wonderful product!

Grew up with them as a kid in California. Then disappeared for years. Found them while in the midwest for business and then on amazon. I'm very happy to have a breakfast favorite back!

This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better.

This has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf.  i don't like drinking caffeine throughout the day.  I would recommend this as it's easy to carry with you in your purse, briefcase, or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water.  It only adds 5 calories though.  Great stuff.

I may not be a culinary expert, but I know taste.  This basil has a more intense and better flavor than I had experienced with any other dried basil.  I highly recommend it.

Walmart has the 48 family sized tea bags for $5.99, so you can get the same 96 family sized tea bags from Walmart for half the price $11.99

This new "Packaging" is more expensive than the last plus it's smaller - 23.2 oz vs. the 25 in the old packaging.  Granted it's nice not having to fish around for the scooper, but there's no reason to increase pricing on this.  Target had the 25 oz for $19.99 at one point (maybe try to clear old packaging for new) - now it's at $21.05 still cheaper than what I've seen online - even for amazon- so far...

I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.

The first time I ordered this, it was great.  After adjusting my grind, it made the perfect espresso with a thick crema.  However, subsequent orders left much to be desired.  Some were OK... Some were horrible... None were great.

There isn't a whole lot that is special about Stride Gum. I kind of got annoyed chewing it all the time. It doesn't really freshen your breath and you don't get the "clean" feeling of other gums. It doesn't really last that long either so I wasn't too fond of it. Either way if your a fan of Stride go for it.

BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER

I have bought this at a local pet shop for my koi. The fish do well on this product and I just found it is also sold through Amazon for about 30% less.

My two dogs adore Greenies!  This seemed to be the best place & price I found online.  Very quickly shipped too.

My dog hates this food, and through some research I have found that Science Diet is not very good quality. I have instead switched over to Orijen, a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog.

I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive.

This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The "mouth feel" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.   The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.  This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an "emergency treat" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.

I was very pleased with the shipping of this item. When I thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty, it had actually come 2 days prior.  My dog couldn't be happier

I have a puppy that absolutely loves them! She considers them her personal "reward" for everything she does. A good training aid.

In my opinion, the DHA soymilks always taste the best and are the most creamy. Doesn't hurt that they are healthy, too! I usually drink Silk Brain & Bone health soymilk at home but was looking for smaller containers to bring to work. I tried the ZenSoy cappuccino flavor and was pleasantly surprised. It's very delicious and is a nice change from plain soymilk.
